<p>In the sweet and balmy springtime the sedate senior’s
fancy lightly turns to thoughts of frivolity. All
through the weary winter months he may have carried
himself with the grave dignity that so well becomes a
senior; but when the spring comes something stirs
within him, and as the world turns green and the birds
begin to twitter that something takes hold of him with
a grip that makes him its servant. A strange sensation
of restlessness pervades his entire being, running
over his nerves like little electric thrills, setting his
muscles itching, his heart throbbing, his whole body
aching&mdash;aching to do something, anything, everything.</p>

<p>This is a very dangerous condition for a senior to
fall into, and yet nearly all of them suffer from an
attack of it. It drags them to the border-line of recklessness,
and while it possesses them in all its awesome
force, there is no desperate thing it might not
lead them into. It even has the power to make them
forget for a while that the whole world has its eyes
fastened upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>There must be some vent for this spring-coltish
feeling which assails the senior. Until he became a
senior he could occasionally disport himself as a boy,
but now for some months the burden of his exalted
station in the world has roosted on his shoulders until
it has become almost too heavy to bear. He longs to
fling it off and be a boy again.</p>

<p>That’s it&mdash;that’s what ails the grave-faced senior
when he feels that queer sensation running over the
electric-wires of his body, which are known as the
nerves. For the first time in life he realizes that his
boyhood is slipping from him, and he makes a clutch
at it to drag it back for one last look into its happy
face before he is parted from it forever.</p>

<p>How sad a thing it is to part with boyhood forever;
and yet how many do so without a sigh or a regret!
It is only in after years that they wake up to understand
how great was their loss. Some, well aware
that the hour has come for boyhood to bid them farewell,
turn to look after it fondly, even when their feet
are set on the new road that manhood has led them
into. Good-by, happy boyhood! this is the final parting;
we shall never meet again. Of course, it’s a
grand thing to be a man, but it’s only after we have
become men that we realize how grand it was to be
a boy.</p>

<p>The senior has been playing at being a man. He
has carried a sober face, his manner has been sedate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and he has been very much impressed with his own
importance. All this has begun to wear upon him, and
with the awakening of spring he wakes up also to a
knowledge of what is happening. By Jove! it’s a
serious thing, after all, to permit boyhood to drift
away without so much as a word of farewell. This
hits him hard, and he suddenly stretches out his hands
to that part of himself that he has so carelessly thrust
aside.</p>

<p>Behold a lot of dignified Yale seniors wooing back
their boyhood on a sunny spring day. You’d scarcely
know them now. There in one group are Aldrich,
who carried off the honors as a drum-major in the political
rally last fall; Tomlinson, widely celebrated as
a “greasy grind;” Browning, the laziest man on earth;
Hodge, famous on the gridiron or the diamond, and
Merriwell, famous the country over. And what are
they doing?</p>

<p>Spinning tops! So help me, they are spinning tops!</p>

<p>But look around and you will see scores of well-known
seniors engaged in the same surprising occupation.
They enter into the spirit of if with the combined
hilarity of boys and dignity of men. If you
look beneath the surface, it may seem rather pathetic
to witness this great crowd of intellectual young men
seriously engaged in a last romp with their departing
boyhood.</p>

<p>There is Porter, the famous poet of the Lit., frolicking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
down the walk, trundling a hoop before him
with the apparent satisfaction of a lad of seven. See!
his hoop collides with that of Gammel, the great
Dwight Hall orator, and there is a general mixup.
But they’re not real boys. They’re only men playing
that they are boys. If they had been boys that collision
might have resulted in an exchange of blows,
instead of an exchange of bows.</p>

<p>Over yonder are more seniors spinning tops or rolling
hoops. And a great throng of men from other
classes stand off and watch “the sport,” commenting
upon it sagely.</p>

<p>This top-spinning and hoop-rolling serves as a vent
for the pent-up steam that has been threatening an explosion.
The safety-valve is open, and the rollicking
seniors proceed to let ’er sizz. There are other ways
of letting off steam, but surely this is far better than
the sign-stealing and gate-shifting recklessness of the
freshmen.</p>

<p>This is a part of the life of Yale, a scene peculiar to
the balmy days of early spring. It is one of the memories
that old grads. smile over in after years. It is
peculiar and characteristic of Old Eli; to eliminate
it would be to take away something that seems to aid
in making Yale what it is.</p>

<p>By themselves the Chickering set had gathered to
look on and make comment. Their observations were
most edifying. These remarks tell how the gray matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in their little heads is working. It has to work
hard for them to think, for they have dulled the gray
matter with cigarettes and hot suppers and lack of
proper exertion. Yet somehow these “men” manage
to keep along in their classes, and somehow they pass
examinations, and somehow they will graduate, as
hundreds and thousands like them graduate from colleges
all over our land.</p>

<p>“Look at that big elephant, Bruce Browning!”
lisped Lew Veazie, in derision. “Thee him thpinning
a top, fellowth! Ithn’th that a thight faw thore
eyeth!”</p>

<p>“And that cheap fellow Hodge,” said Ollie Lord,
pointing with his cane. “Just look at him, gentlemen!
Isn’t it just perfectly comical to see him spinning
a top! Oh, dear, dear, dear!”</p>

<p>“And Merriwell,” said Rupert Chickering, whose
trousers looked as if they had been freshly pressed that
day. “It is a sad spectacle to see a man like that lose
his dignity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off!” croaked Tilton Hull, his collar
holding his chin so high that he seemed to be addressing
his remarks to a twittering sparrow on a limb
over his head. “That’s about the only kind of sport
Merriwell is suited for.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” said Gene Skelding gloomily, exhibiting
deep depression, for all that he was wearing a dazzling
new pink shirt; “we can say whatever we like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
about Merriwell, but it’s plain he’s on top of the bunch
to stay.”</p>

<p>They all regarded him in amazement, for always he
had been the fiercest against Frank.</p>

<p>“This from you!” cried Julian Ives, smiting his bang
a terrible smack with his open hand and almost staggering.
“What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that we may as well own up to the truth.
He has pulled himself up to the top, and everything
we or others have done or said has been fruitless in
pulling him down.”</p>

<p>No wonder they were amazed! Skelding had been
one who had often taken a hand in some daring move
against Merriwell. The others to a man had lacked
nerve, but Gene was reckless, and they knew it. He
had never seemed to give up hope; but now, all at
once, he flung up the sponge. Why shouldn’t they
show consternation?</p>

<p>Behind his collar Tilton Hull gave a gurgling groan.</p>

<p>“It’s not Merriwell’s strength that has placed him
on top,” he said despairingly. “He is not a strong
man.”</p>

<p>“Not in any sense,” said Julian Ives.</p>

<p>“He’s strong enough in his way. No other Yale
man has ever done the things he has done and kept on
top. Think of him, a senior, going into the freshman
boat as coxswain in place of the coxswain the sophs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
had stolen! The nerve of the thing is colossal. But
what would have befallen any other senior who dared
do such a thing? He would have got it in the neck.
How about Merriwell? Why, everybody seems to
think he did a clever thing in palming himself off as
Earl Knight, the freshman. A man who can do a
thing like that and come off all right is too strong to
be thrown down. It’s no use, he is on top for good.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he ith verwy thwong,” simpered
Veazie. “He ith a gweat bwute! But there are otherth
jutht ath thwong ath he ith. I weally believe he
thinkth himthelf a Thandow.”</p>

<p>“I was not thinking of his physical strength,” said
Skelding; “though it seems that he’s pretty nearly as
strong that way as any other. You know they say he
defeated that strange athlete of the scarred face.”</p>

<p>“That’s a story his friends tell, don’t you know,
dear boy,” said Ollie Lord. “How can anybody be
sure it’s true?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there is much doubt of it,” said
Gene, still with great gloom. “He is as strong one
way as another, and that makes his position impregnable.
He’s king of Yale.”</p>

<p>“It thirtenly ith a thwange thight to thee a king
thpinning a top,” giggled Veazie.</p>

<p>“Come away!” croaked Hull, still with his eyes on
the limb where the sparrow had perched. “Gene is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in need of something to brace him up. Let’s get out
of here for a stroll.”</p>

<p>So the Chickering set dragged themselves away, all
feeling greatly depressed by the words of Skelding, for
when he gave up, hope seemed crumbling ashes.</p>

<p>They had continued to hope that something would
bring about the downfall of Merriwell. In Chickering’s
perfumed rooms they had talked of the possibility.
Even though every adverse circumstance seemed
to turn in Merry’s favor, still they hugged the gasping
form of hope and fanned breath into its pinched
nostrils. Now they beheld it dead in their arms, for
Skelding had grown tired and refused to fan any
more.</p>

<p>In a gloomy group they left the campus and crossed
the green. Few words passed between them, but all
seemed to know where they were going. Into the
Tontine Hotel they made their way and disappeared,
for there they knew a room where they could be served
with whatever they ordered, and no one would be
permitted to trouble them.</p>

<p>It was fully an hour later when they issued from
the hotel. There was a wild light in Skelding’s eyes,
and his teeth were set. Hull had a flush in his cheeks,
but his weak chin would have dropped had his collar
permitted. Ives’ bang was rumpled, and he did not
care. He was humming a tune. Lew and Ollie were
clinging to each other, and making a pretense of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
very sober, in order to attract attention to the fact
that they had been drinking. Rupert had his hat
canted at a rakish angle over one ear.</p>

<p>This is the Chickering set full of fuddle. Look out
for them now, for they are real reckless. How strong
they are now! You can see it in their faces and in
the steadiness of their walk. And they demonstrate it
by their language.</p>

<p>“It ith no uthe!” Veazie declared; “I don’t take a
bit of thstock in thstorieth they tell about Fwank Merriwell
being tho thwong. I think he ith weal weak.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, chummie!” chirped Ollie Lord, flourishing
his cane in a fierce gesture. “We’d not be afraid
of him, would we?”</p>

<p>“No, thir!” cried Lew; “not a bit!”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” said Ollie. “If we were to meet
him we’d give him a shove.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to give him a thove!” said Veazie, shaking
his terrible fist in the empty air. But somehow his
other hand stole round behind him and hovered over
a place that had once been spanked by Merriwell’s
open palm.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about the creature!” croaked Hull loftily.
“He should be beneath our notice. We’ve settled
the fact that he is not strong in any way. We
did that back in the hotel after we took the second
drink. Now, drop it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, drop it!” grated Skelding. “He’s been given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
every kind of a chance to demonstrate his strength,
but I know it’s been nothing but luck. I could have
done the same thing, had I been given the same chance.
But I never have a chance.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not revile Merriwell,” murmured Chickering.
“Let’s try to be charitable.”</p>

<p>“But I wouldn’t turn out for him if I were to meet
him face to face right&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tilton Hull stopped speaking with a gulp, for he had
come face to face with Merriwell.</p>


    <div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="no-brk"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="fs70 lsp3">A STRONG ARM.</span></h2>


<p>Hull did not pause to make any kind of a bluff, but
he turned out with remarkable alacrity, for Merriwell’s
eyes were fastened upon him and seemed to go through
him like knives. Those eyes seemed quite enough to
turn any one aside.</p>

<p>Seeing Tilton make that abrupt swerve, Veazie and
Lord looked for the cause, and beheld Merry within
two strides of them. They nearly fell over each other
in their haste to get away, and they went clean off
the sidewalk into the gutter.</p>

<p>Chickering pretended not to see Merry, although he
could not help swerving aside the least bit. Ives suddenly
became busy with his bang, and Skelding was
the only man of the whole lot who ventured to give
Frank one savage glance. But Merry paid no heed
to Skelding, who was not in his path at all, and walked
on. Gene was mad.</p>

<p>“Well, I swear, you are like a lot of frightened
sheep!” he snarled, regarding the rest with scorn.
“You make me sick, the whole of you!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Rupert, with pretended
surprise. “What made everybody dodge aside so?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Then he looked back and saw Frank. “Can it be?”
he said, in great disgust. “Really, it’s too bad!”</p>

<p>In disgust Skelding left the sidewalk and started to
cross the street. The others flocked after him stragglingly.</p>

<p>Then there was a great rumpus and uproar down
the street. Men shouted and ran for the sidewalks,
teams got out of the way in a hurry, and the electric
car at the crossing slid over barely in time.</p>

<p>And right down on the Chickering set bore two
runaway horses attached to a bounding, rocking, reeling
carriage. The driver was gone from his seat, the
reins were flying loose, and the two ladies in the carriage
were quite helpless. At any moment they might
be thrown out and killed. At any moment the mad
horses might crash into another carriage, a car, a
stone post, the curbing, or something that would cap
the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Men looked on helplessly, or ran after the reeling
carriage, shouting and waving their arms. Women
shuddered, screamed, and turned pale.</p>

<p>Was there no one to stop the runaway? Yes,
there was the famous strong policeman of that beat!
Everybody knew him. He would stop the horses. He
ran out before them.</p>

<p>Then the crowd watched the officer perform the
wonderful feat. He was a giant in stature, and he had
Hercules-like arms and legs. He hurled himself fearlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
at the heads of the frightened beasts, caught
with one hand, clung, and was dragged.</p>

<p>“He’s down!”</p>

<p>Women covered their eyes to shut out the spectacle.
He had failed to obtain a good hold on the bridles of
the horses, his hands slipped, he hung desperately,
and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It seemed that those terrible hoofs beat him down
and went over him, leaving him lying there.</p>

<p>At first the Chickering set had seemed dazed by
the commotion. Their brains were fuddled, and they
hesitated fairly in the track of peril.</p>

<p>“Run, you fools!” shouted somebody. “Get out of
the way, or you’ll be killed!”</p>

<p>As the others take to their heels and scamper for a
place of safety, it is seen that one remains behind.</p>

<p>It is Skelding.</p>

<p>On came the terrified horses, and Gene braced himself
for the effort that was to land him in the halls of
fame&mdash;or in a cemetery.</p>

<p>The latter thought came upon him with appalling
force as he saw those mad horses almost within reach.
Their eyes were glaring, their teeth were set on the
bits, their lips flung great flecks of foam, and the muscular
play of their thrashing legs, bounding bodies,
and shod hoofs, beating fire from the flinty stones,
was enough to shake the nerve of a would-be hero.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
The power of their mad rush was something against
which it seemed that no frail human arm could avail.</p>

<p>The thought of fame had led Gene to halt there; but
now the thought of something quite different got hold
of him. He saw himself hurled to the stones with
broken bones, maimed for life, perhaps. If he lived,
he would hobble through life a miserable cripple. But
he might be killed! It would be a glorious thing to
die the death of a hero, but even that was not quite
enough inducement.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that, at the last minute, Skelding
made a backward spring and a scramble to get out
of the way, not even lifting his hand to try to stop
the horses.</p>

<p>At another time his haste might have seemed comical
and caused the spectators to roar with laughter;
but just now the peril of the helpless women in the
carriage prevented any one from laughing.</p>

<p>But another Yale man has rushed out into the street
and prepared to make an attempt to check those
horses. As they approach, he runs in the same direction
they are going. They come up beside him, and
he swerves in toward them at exactly the right moment,
having watched their approach over his shoulder.
Then he leaps at their heads, gets them firmly by
the bridles, and holds fast with a grip that nothing can
break.</p>

<p>The crowd looks on in breathless anxiety and admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
All had expected to see this beardless youth
flung down and trampled as the policeman had been
trampled, but nothing of the kind occurs.</p>

<p>What wonderful strength he must have, for he has
checked the mad rush of the horses at once! Though
they plunge and rear, he holds them fast and sets them
back with a surge of his arm, which seems to have
muscles of steel. They do not carry him half a block
before he had brought them to a stand and holds them
there, his jaw squared, his cheeks flushed a bit, but his
broad chest scarcely seeming to rise and fall with more
than usual rapidity. It is the deed of a man of wonderful
nerve, skill, and strength.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” some ask.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Merriwell!” others reply, as if all should
know him.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Merriwell who had stopped the horses.
He gave them his entire attention till he had them
quite under subjection. Then other men came to his
assistance, and he could leave them for a moment.</p>

<p>Frank stepped back to the carriage, politely lifting
his hat, and saying:</p>

<p>“I trust neither of you is harmed, ladies? Your
driver&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped, staring, astonished, wondering. The
golden-haired girl was gazing at him in unspeakable
admiration.</p>

<p>“Elsie!” he gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>For it was Elsie Bellwood! Then he glanced at the
lady at Elsie’s side.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Parker! Well, this is a surprise!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Parker had been ready to faint, but now she
recovered enough to say:</p>

<p>“How can we ever thank you, Mr. Merriwell? You
saved our lives! There is no doubt of it!”</p>

<p>“When they ran away,” said Elsie, “when the
driver fell off, I felt that somehow, somewhere, Frank
would turn up and stop them. He did it!”</p>

<p>Her face was full of triumph. Although she still
shook with the excitement of the adventure through
which she had passed, there was happiness in that look
she gave him.</p>

<p>Somehow that look stabbed him to the heart. Was
it a look of love? Why had she not fancied that
Hodge might be the one to stop the horses? In that
moment, when he might have been well satisfied with
himself for what he had done, Frank Merriwell felt
miserable.</p>

<p>“Elsie,” he said, “I did not know you were in the
city.”</p>

<p>“We came to-day,” said Mrs. Parker. “I have a
brother who lives in Hamden.”</p>

<p>They had not let him know they were coming. He
did not believe Hodge had known it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parker refused to ride farther in the carriage.
She declared the horses could not be managed. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
so, as the dirt-covered driver came panting up, angry,
ashamed, and humble, Frank was helping them from
the carriage. He had offered to take the driver’s
place himself, but Mrs. Parker would not even trust
one who had shown his power to check the mad runaways.</p>

<p>“I shall return in a car,” she added. “Brother
George shall not induce me to come out behind those
terrible creatures again.”</p>

<p>Elsie had given Frank’s hand a gentle pressure as
he helped her to alight.</p>

<p>“I was awfully frightened,” she whispered; “but I
knew you would stop the horses the moment I saw
you.”</p>

<p>She trusted him&mdash;she trusted him still! And she
did not know the truth.</p>

<p>He was engaged to Inza!</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">MAKING A FRIEND.</span></h2>


<p>Bart Hodge had missed Merry from the throng of
rollicking seniors. A little while before Frank had
been in the midst of the sport; now he was gone. For
a while Hodge continued to take part in the top-spinning,
but his heart was not in it. He looked
around and saw that he was not the only one who
found it impossible to drag back his boyhood in such
a manner. He saw that there were others who were
taking part in the top-spinning simply because it was
a privilege of seniors at this time. Some there were
who laughed and joked and were merry, but, strangely
enough, it seemed to Bart that these did not realize
how sad a thing it was to lose their boyhood. So
Hodge drifted away by himself, giving himself up to
thoughts that were both pleasant and otherwise.</p>

<p>Bart’s boyhood had not been the pleasantest imaginable.
His father was a careless, self-indulgent man,
and he had given little thought to the manner in which
Bart was coming up. Bart had been given almost
everything he desired, and, thus pampered, it was not
strange that he came to be regarded as a “spoiled
child.” If he fretted for anything, he was given that
which he desired in order to pacify him. Finding that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he could win his own way with a pout and a whine,
he pouted and whined more and more.</p>

<p>His mother saw with some alarm what was happening,
but it was useless for her to try to reason
with his father. “Oh, give the boy what he wants,
and keep him still!” was the way Bart’s father settled
it. His mother, knowing the real disposition of his
father, feared for the future, and her fears were justified.</p>

<p>As Bart grew older, his demands became harder to
satisfy, but he had a way of making life miserable for
everybody around if he did not get his way. More
and more he annoyed his father. “The boy must go
away to school,” Mr. Hodge had decided at last. His
mother would have kept him home a little longer, but
his father had decreed.</p>

<p>Bart, however, had no fancy for going away to
school. He swore he would not stay, and he did not.
In less than two weeks he was sent home, expelled.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Hodge was furious. “We’ll see about
this, sir!” he said. “An ordinary boarding-school is
not strict enough. You shall attend a military school.”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” said Bart.</p>

<p>But he did&mdash;for a month. Then he came home
again. The principal said he was incorrigible.</p>

<p>“We’ll see!” said Mr. Hodge, and his face was black
as a storm-cloud. “I’ll give you one more chance,
young man. This is the last one! If you are expelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
again&mdash;well, you need not come back here! You may
shift for yourself!”</p>

<p>Bart knew he meant just that, but even then he did
not care. He had such a bad disposition that he longed
to be expelled in order to “spite” his father. “I’d
like to show him that he can’t force me into anything!”
muttered Bart.</p>

<p>And so, when he was packed off to Fardale, he went
with bitterness in his heart. During the journey he
regarded with satisfaction the possibility that he would
soon be expelled from this school. He pictured himself
as turned from his own home, set adrift an outcast.
He pictured himself as a reckless youngster, going
to sea, perhaps. He would see many strange
lands, lead a wild life, be shipwrecked, make a fortune
in some far country, come home and treat his
bent and aged father with kindness and magnanimity,
caring for him in his declining years. He would be
able to say: “Well, father, you see I bear no grudge,
even if you did treat me in a shabby manner when I
was a boy. I’ve made myself what I am, no thanks
to you. It’s all right; but I can’t quite forget.”</p>

<p>But this fancy did not give him so much satisfaction
as another that came to him. In this he saw
himself wandering homeless over the world, living
a wretched life, drinking, associating with bad men,
sinking lower and lower. At last, having fallen to the
depths, he might drag himself back home. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
be met by a stern father, who still rebuffed him. On
his knees he would beg for one chance. When he was
refused, he’d go out and break into a bank or something.
Then, as he stood in the dock to receive sentence
for his crime, he would turn to his father, point
an accusing finger at the cowering man, and cry out,
in a terrible voice: “You are responsible for it all!
My sins are on your head!”</p>

<p>Having such thoughts as these, Bart was in a rebellious
mood that day when he stepped off the train
at Fardale station. His first act had been to kick a
poodle dog that came within reach of his foot. That
kick had led him into trouble with a bright-faced
stripling who had also arrived on that train. Later
on he had fought this stripling in an open field on a
moonlight night. The fight had been interrupted,
but in his heart Bart knew the stripling would have
whipped him if it had continued to a finish, and he
hated the stripling with a hatred he fancied undying.</p>

<p>The stripling was Frank Merriwell, and so they
were enemies when they first met at Fardale.</p>

<p>Certain it is that Hodge in those days was ready to
stoop to almost anything in order to get the best of an
enemy, and many were the questionable and unfair
things he did.</p>

<p>But, no matter how unfair Hodge was, Merriwell
always fought fair and aboveboard. Bart had not fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that anybody lived who would never accept an
opportunity to take an unfair advantage of an enemy,
and, at first, he could not understand Merriwell. Like
many others in after years, he first mistook Merry’s
squareness and generosity for timidity. The time
came, however, when he realized that Frank Merriwell
was as courageous as a lion.</p>

<p>The test that won Hodge to Frank came when
Merry might have caused Bart’s expulsion from the
academy by a word which would have made Bart seem
guilty of a reprehensible thing that he had not committed.
Hodge knew that Frank held him in his
power; he knew that the proof of his guilt must seem
convincing to Merry. For once in his life Bart was
frightened, for he suddenly realized what it meant to
him if he were expelled from Fardale. His mother’s
letters had convinced him that there was no hope of his
father relenting in such an event. “I’m done for!”
said Bart, to himself. And he wondered why Merriwell
did not strike. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Had he possesed'">Had he possessed</ins> such a hold on
Frank, he would have struck, even though he had
known Merry was innocent.</p>

<p>Then came an accident at the academy that showed
another cadet with the same initials as Bart was guilty,
and Hodge was saved. Still he wondered why Merriwell
had held his hand. “Why did you do it, Merriwell?”
he asked, pointblank. “Because I was not
absolutely certain that you were guilty,” Frank answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
“It looked that way, didn’t it?” “Yes, it
looked that way.” “I should have been expelled if you
had accused me.” “I think you would, Hodge.”
“You had no reason to like me, Merriwell.” “I did
not like you,” Frank admitted. “Then why didn’t you
accuse me and get me out of the way?” “Because to
save my life I would not charge my worst enemy with
a crime of which he might be innocent.”</p>

<p>Bart remembered this conversation. He had pondered
over it, and it had opened his eyes to the difference
between himself and Frank Merriwell. All at
once he saw that this fellow whom he hated was his
superior in every way. He had suspected it before,
and it had made him hate Merry more intensely; but
now the full knowledge of the fact brought him a different
feeling.</p>

<p>Not all at once did Bart surrender to Frank. He
tried to keep away from Merriwell, but the rules of
the military school threw them together singularly,
making them roommates. Never were two fellows less
alike. But Bart found that, for all of his sense of justice
and honor, Merriwell was no milksop. Frank
could defend his rights, and he did so often enough.</p>

<p>The end of it all was that Hodge became passionately
attached to Frank, even though he tried to conceal
the fact. He would have fought to the death for
Merriwell at a time when he had not ceased to sneer
and say bitter things about him. Others did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
how much he cared for Frank; he tried to hide it even
from himself.</p>

<p>That friendship for Frank Merriwell was the making
of Hodge. Frank was a splendid model. Unconsciously
Bart began to imitate him, and the work of
changing his selfish, revengeful nature went on
slowly but surely. In time Hodge realized that he
owed the great change to Frank, but he was not aware
of it so much while it was taking place.</p>

<p>Inza had lived there in Fardale, and Bart admired
her. But she was dark-haired and dark-eyed like Bart
himself, and she took no great fancy to him. Merriwell’s
success with Inza annoyed him at first.</p>

<p>Then came Elsie.</p>

<p>But it was Merriwell who had done most in saving
her from her father’s shipwrecked vessel, which went
to pieces on Tiger Tooth Ledge, off the coast at Fardale,
one wild night, and it was Merriwell on whom
the golden-haired girl smiled. The first sight of her
had aroused a strange sensation deep down in Bart’s
heart; but she would not even give him a glance.</p>

<p>That did not make him bitter toward Frank. Instead,
he became bitter toward girls in general. He
told himself that he hated them all, and that he would
never have anything to do with any of them. So, for
a long, long time, Bart Hodge believed himself a
“woman-hater.”</p>

<p>He had kept himself from Elsie. When he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of her he turned his mind on other things. She
troubled him a great deal for a time, but at last, after
being put out of his mind so many times, she bothered
him less and less. He had not fancied himself in love
with her. He would have ridiculed such a thing as
preposterous.</p>

<p>But the time came when, on the burning steamer, he
knew the truth in a sudden burst of light. He had
loved her all the time, and, rather than be false to
Frank; he had remained silent. In the face of what
seemed certain death, his lips had been unsealed, and
he had told her of his love.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;strange fate!&mdash;Merriwell himself had battered
down the partition and dragged them out to life.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the happiest moment of Bart’s life
when he learned that Frank had found he loved Inza
and she loved him. With Frank and Inza engaged,
it seemed that there was no barrier left between him
and Elsie.</p>

<p>He had known that he was going to meet Elsie in
Charlottesville during the Easter trip of the ball-team,
and he had made Frank promise to let him tell her
everything, for she remained unaware of the engagement
between Merry and Inza.</p>

<p>When the time came, however, Bart longed to learn
from Elsie that she loved him most before telling her
what had happened. He felt that not for anything
would he wish to think she had accepted him because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
she knew Frank was lost to her. It was the great
longing of his heart to be first in her heart.</p>

<p>And so, fearing what her answer might be unless
she knew all, he had begged her to wait a little before
making it. And he had left Charlottesville and Virginia
without telling her of the engagement of Frank
and Inza. Not, however, till they were back in New
Haven did he confess this to Frank.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do it!” he cried, alone with Merry in his
room. “I long to hear her tell me she loves me most
without having her know that you can never be anything
to her. That would settle every doubt for the
present and for all time.”</p>

<p>“I can’t blame you, Bart,” said Merry. “I believe
I understand how you feel. But I fear you lost your
courage when the right moment came.”</p>

<p>“Gods, Merriwell! who wouldn’t lose courage? Her
answer was to make or mar my whole future. I
longed to cry out: ‘Frank and Inza are engaged.’ But
the fear that it would be that alone which would give
her to me made me keep silent. I want her to love
me because not even Frank Merriwell is as much to
her.”</p>

<p>“I hope she will, Hodge,” said Merry sincerely;
“and something tells me that she will. It will all
come right, old man.”</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">THE STRONGEST MAN.</span></h2>


<p>Bart wandered from the campus and left the vicinity
of the college. He walked by himself through the
streets, thinking of these things. With his mind thus
occupied, he gave little thought to the direction he was
taking. In time he came round into Church Street,
and he was barely in time to see Merriwell assisting a
young lady onto a car.</p>

<p>Hodge stopped. His heart had leaped into his
throat, for he recognized the girl. Even then he
brushed his hand over his eyes, as if in doubt. It did
not seem possible that Elsie Bellwood could be there
in New Haven without his knowledge.</p>

<p>He had not seen the elderly lady Frank aided onto
the car in advance of Elsie. He saw nothing but
Elsie.</p>

<p>Then he made a single step, as if to dash forward.
Elsie turned and spoke something to Frank in a low
tone, giving him a sweet smile, and Bart stopped as
if shot. That smile seemed to strike straight through
the heart of Bart Hodge. He would have given the
world to have her smile on him like that.</p>

<p>The horrible conviction that she still loved Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
seized upon him. The whole affair was very remarkable,
to say the least.</p>

<p>How had Frank known she was there in New
Haven? Bart told himself that Merry must have
known it, else why had he left the campus to meet
her? It did not occur to Hodge that the meeting had
been by accident. He knew nothing of the runaway.
He believed Elsie had sent Merriwell word that she
was coming to New Haven, and he had met her by
appointment.</p>

<p>A terrible feeling of jealous rage took possession of
him as he hurried away. That feeling, which was
like a terrible, crushing pain in his bosom, drove reason
and sober thought from him. For the time he was a
furious fool in the grasp of the fiercest passion that
can sway a human being&mdash;a passion that has overthrown
empires. Oh, the terrible things he told himself!
He strode on and on, his face black as midnight,
his heart in a wild tumult.</p>

<p>How he hated Merriwell now! At last he felt that
he knew Frank Merriwell’s one weak point. Merriwell
was deceiving both Elsie and Inza! Even now
that he had proposed to Inza and been accepted, he
was not satisfied to give Elsie up.</p>

<p>But Merry had deceived him; Bart told himself that
over and over. He had slipped away from the rollicking
seniors that he might keep the appointment with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Elsie unknown to Hodge. Was not that a wretched
trick?</p>

<p>All the old hatred he had once entertained for
Frank, renewed and redoubled by his jealousy, swayed
him now. He felt that he could kill Merriwell without
a feeling of remorse. Why not? Was not Frank
deceiving Elsie? And a wretch who would deceive
her deserved death!</p>

<p>Bart knew that Elsie trusted Frank implicitly. She
believed him the soul of honor, and the thought that
he could deceive her in any way had never for a
moment entered her mind. But he was deceiving her!
Why was he doing it? Was it possible that he had
grown sorry because of his proposal to Inza? Was
it possible that he thought of giving Inza up and turning
to Elsie?</p>

<p>Hodge asked himself these questions as he swung
along, coming into Whitney Avenue. Away he went
to the north, covering the ground with great speed,
seeking to walk off the terrible feeling that possessed
him.</p>

<p>At last he came to the outskirts of the city. To the
right lay East Rock Park; ahead was Lake Whitney.
Bart felt like losing himself somewhere in the country
and not returning to college. He did not wish to
look on Merriwell’s face again. Always he had seen
honesty and frankness there; but now he felt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
would be able to detect deceit and treachery lurking
somewhere about it.</p>

<p>Deceit and treachery in Frank Merriwell! That
meant that the Merriwell he had known in the past
was dead!</p>

<p>Bart tired of the highway. He longed to plunge
into the woods, and he struck across some fields toward
a distant grove, into which he made his way.
There he felt that he would be quite alone, but he was
mistaken. In the midst of the grove he found a
lodgelike house, the doors of which were standing
open. Near this house, in the grove, a large, broad-shouldered,
muscular-looking man stood contemplating
a large stone on the ground at his feet. His hat,
coat, and vest were off, and his sleeves were thrust
back, showing a massive forearm.</p>

<p>Bart paused to look at the man, admiring his Herculean
build. Then the man looked up, as if he had
known all the time that Bart was there, and called to
him.</p>

<p>“Come here,” commanded the stranger, in a heavy
voice. “I have something to show you.”</p>

<p>With his curiosity strangely aroused, Bart advanced.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, as he paused near the man.</p>

<p>“Do you see that stone?”</p>

<p>The man pointed at the large rock at his feet.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know how much it weighs?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can lift it?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you try it.”</p>

<p>Hodge wondered at the peculiar manner of the
man.</p>

<p>“Why should I try to lift it?” he asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, just to show how strong you are.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to show how strong I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to show you how strong I am.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“I cannot, unless you take hold of that rock and convince
yourself that it is heavy. When you have done
that, I will show you how light it is.”</p>

<p>Possessed by a sudden impulse, Bart stooped and
took hold of the stone. But try as he might, he could
not lift it from the ground.</p>

<p>With a strange smile on his face, the muscular giant
of the grove watched Bart’s unavailing efforts.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” he laughed. “It is heavy, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” admitted Bart, as he straightened up. “It
must weigh half a ton.”</p>

<p>“As much as that,” nodded the man.</p>

<p>“You knew I could not lift it.”</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not believe you can budge it.”</p>

<p>“You shall see.”</p>

<p>Then the man bent his broad back, obtained a hold
on the stone with his hands, and, to the astonishment
of Hodge, lifted it fully two feet from the ground
with no great apparent effort.</p>

<p>“What do you think now?” he cried triumphantly,
as he let it drop.</p>

<p>“I think it is remarkable!” exclaimed Hodge, looking
at the man in wondering admiration.</p>

<p>“I knew you would,” said the stranger, with a show
of satisfaction. “Can you keep a secret?”</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you something.”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“I am the strongest man in the world!”</p>

<p>These words were spoken with perfect seriousness,
as if the one who uttered them believed them fully.</p>

<p>“Are you?” asked Bart, beginning to feel that there
was something very peculiar about this man.</p>

<p>“Yes. You are the only one besides myself who
knows it. I decided to tell you as soon as I saw
you.”</p>

<p>“Do you live here?” asked Bart, looking toward
the lodge and seeking to turn the subject.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I only come here to get strong. I had
this hut built here for that purpose.”</p>

<p>“Do you live near here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; this is my property all around here. I have
discovered the secret of becoming strong. Although
I am now the strongest man in the world, I shall keep
right on getting stronger. The time will come when
I’ll be stronger than a hundred men combined.”</p>

<p>Now, Bart understood that there must be something
the matter with the man’s mind, although he
had little the appearance of a lunatic.</p>

<p>“I have let no one know why I come here to this
place at a certain hour every day,” the stranger went
on. “I knew they would laugh at me, and it makes
me angry when any one laughs at me. Don’t laugh,
young man! I am very disagreeable when I am
angry.”</p>

<p>Bart had no thought of laughing.</p>

<p>“This is a pretty place,” he observed.</p>

<p>“It’s quiet and secluded,” nodded the man; “yet it
is so near the house that I can easily hear them when
they ring the bell for me. They think I come here
to study medicine. Why, I completed the study of
medicine long ago. I let them think that, however,
for they would not understand if they knew what I was
really studying. Any man who knows the secret may
become strong if he is willing to shorten his life. You
look surprised. I will explain. In order to acquire
my present amount of strength, I have been compelled
to boil down and concentrate the strength of several
years into one year, and my life has been shortened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
just that much. But it is a glorious thing to know that
I am the strongest man in the world. I am bound
to become famous, and almost any man is willing to
sacrifice a few years of life in order to win enduring
fame. Perhaps you think my fame will not endure,
but you are wrong. The fame of Samson has endured,
and I shall become even stronger than Samson.
I know the secret that Samson knew. It did not
lay in his hair. What fools they were to think so!
But I know the secret. It will take a little time for
me to condense all the strength of years to come in
one year, but I shall succeed, and then I’ll astound
the world. With ease I’ll be able to pick up a horse
and fling it over my head, as if it were light as a cat.
I’ll have the power to topple over houses as if they
were built of cards. I will&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A voice sounded through the grove, calling:</p>

<p>“Doctor Lincoln! Doctor Lincoln!”</p>

<p>Bart started, and listened in amazement.</p>

<p>“Doctor Lincoln! Doctor Lincoln!” called the voice.</p>

<p>It was that of Elsie Bellwood, and he saw her coming
toward him along a path through the grove.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MEETING WITH ELSIE.</span></h2>


<p>In his wild desire to get away somewhere, Hodge
had fancied he must be putting distance between himself
and Elsie. Instead of that, he had hastened to
her. There she was coming along the path. He stood
still and stared at her in amazement.</p>

<p>The man grasped his arm with a grip that seemed
to crush flesh and bone.</p>

<p>“You must not tell her that I am the strongest man
in the world!” he breathed hoarsely. “Promise me
you will not tell her!”</p>

<p>“I promise,” said Bart.</p>

<p>“That is all I ask,” said the man, in a low tone,
releasing his hold on Hodge. “I see by your face that
you are a young man who values his word.”</p>

<p>Then he lifted his voice, and answered:</p>

<p>“Here I am, Miss Bellwood. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Oh, doctor!” called Elsie, “we met with such an
adventure in town. The horses ran away and James
fell off.”</p>

<p>Bart had drawn back. He would have slipped
away, had it been possible to do so without being observed
by the approaching girl, for he felt that he was
in no mood to meet Elsie then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>How pretty she was as she came tripping through
the woods. It seemed to Bart that she had never
looked more beautiful.</p>

<p>She trusted Merriwell, and Merriwell was deceiving
her! Again his heart seethed with indignation, and
just then he felt that he longed to stand face to face
with Frank and say a few things.</p>

<p>In the eyes of Bart Hodge, Elsie was the most
beautiful girl in the world. In her he saw all that
was sweet and good and true. He wondered how it
was possible for Frank to care more for dark-eyed
Inza than for golden-haired Elsie.</p>

<p>“The horses ran away?” exclaimed the “strong
man,” with evident alarm and annoyance. “And James
fell off? Well, James shall be discharged at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was not to blame! He was not strong
enough to hold them when they became frightened.”</p>

<p>“Not strong enough? Then he is not fit for the
place. No man has a right to be weak. Strength
should be sought by all. But I hope, Miss Bellwood,
that the runaway did not result in a disaster?”</p>

<p>“Fortunately not, doctor. The horses were stopped.”</p>

<p>“Good&mdash;very good! Who did it?”</p>

<p>“A policeman tried to stop them first.”</p>

<p>“It was his duty!”</p>

<p>“But he did not succeed. Oh, I was so frightened!
He was thrown down, and I thought he must be killed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
We found out afterward that he was not very badly
hurt.”</p>

<p>“He got hold of the horses?” asked the man
frowning.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he could not hold them.”</p>

<p>“Weakling!” muttered the man, contemptuously.
“Why, had I been in his place, I’d stopped them in their
tracks!”</p>

<p>“They were mad with terror, and it seemed that
no one could check them. But there was a young
man who ran out, got them by the bridles, and brought
them to a stand.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried the man, with a show of interest. “He
must be the possessor of some strength.”</p>

<p>“He’s the greatest athlete in Yale. His name is
Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>Elsie had stopped a short distance away. As he
leaned against a tree which shielded him from her
view, Hodge had not been discovered by her. Standing
thus, Bart heard her tell how Frank had stopped
the runaway horses. It gave him a strange sensation,
and all at once he began to wonder if the meeting between
Frank and Elsie had been unintentional, or
accidental.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I know about him,” said the man called
“doctor.” “I have seen him many times in athletic
sports and games. I presume some men would regard
him as rather strong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“You should have seen him drag those horses to a
stop, doctor! Mrs. Parker wished me to come and
tell you about it. She thought I might find you here,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Elsie stopped. For the first time, she perceived that
the man was not alone. Finding he was discovered,
Bart stepped out into view, lifting his hat.</p>

<p>“Bart Hodge?” she cried, astonished. “Here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Bellwood,” he said, in a tone of voice
that sounded strained and unnatural. “It is a surprise
to us both, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“So you are acquainted?” exclaimed the man, looking
from one to the other. “Well, well!”</p>

<p>Elsie started forward, her hands outstretched.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to see you, Bart!” she cried, her
cheeks turning crimson.</p>

<p>“Are you?” he exclaimed, feeling his heart give a
great throb of joy.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I am!” she asserted, as he met her
and clasped her hands.</p>

<p>“But you did not let me know you were in New
Haven.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find a letter when you get back to town. I
dropped one in the office for you.”</p>

<p>“But Frank knew you were here.”</p>

<p>“He did not know I was coming. Oh, Bart, you
should have seen him fling himself at the heads of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
snorting, terrified horses and bring them to a stop! It
was grand, and it was just like him!”</p>

<p>Admiration for Frank thrilled her; Hodge saw it in
her face and heard it in her voice.</p>

<p>“She loves him still!” he told himself, his heart
sinking.</p>

<p>“Then there was no harm done?” asked the “strong
man,” seeming awakened at last to the possibility
that the runaway might have resulted in damage.</p>

<p>“None, save to the policeman who tried to stop
the horses, doctor. Of course, Mrs. Parker was frightened.
James drove the team home, and we came by
trolley as far as we could, and walked across.”</p>

<p>“I’ll discharge him at once!” declared the man.</p>

<p>“Please don’t!” entreated Elsie, leaving Bart and
turning to the man. She fluttered to him, placing her
gloved hands on his muscular arms and looking up
into his face entreatingly. “I am sure James does not
deserve to be discharged, doctor. Promise me that
you will not do that.”</p>

<p>He melted before her appeal.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he said, “I’ll have to reprimand him,
but, as long as you ask it, I’ll not discharge him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a good doctor!” she laughed. He patted
her cheek, and she turned to Bart in triumph.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, “you must explain how you happen
to be here, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“I left town for a walk, and just wandered along
here; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, wasn’t that odd! And I’m so glad to see
you! You had to leave Charlottesville in such a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” he agreed. “I left much before I
was ready to do so.”</p>

<p>“We are going to stay here for several weeks, perhaps.
Now, if Inza and Winnie were here, how jolly
it would be!”</p>

<p>The man had turned from them to the lodge, the
doors of which he was closing and locking.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Bart, nodding toward him.</p>

<p>“Doctor Lincoln,” she answered. “He is Mrs. Parker’s
brother.”</p>

<p>“You are visiting him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He lives here at Whitney Hill all by himself.”</p>

<p>“Is he a practising physician?”</p>

<p>“No. He has never practised. He is wealthy, and
it has been his fad to experiment. He’s rather peculiar.”</p>

<p>“Rather,” agreed Bart. “I found that out very
quickly.”</p>

<p>“But he is so kind and good. Some people around
here seem afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“Some of the neighbors?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Bart nodded.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p>“Why should they fear him?” she asked. “Hasn’t
a man a right to his own peculiar ways? He built this
lodge here in the grove in order to have a private
laboratory where he could continue his experiments
and investigations undisturbed. He says the neighbors
were very curious about it, and used to come
prying round till he was forced to find ways of frightening
them off. Then they took a dislike to him and
said he was queer.”</p>

<p>“Elsie,” said Bart seriously, “I am afraid Doctor
Lincoln is not just right in his upper story.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you misjudge him!” she whispered. “I am
sure you do! He is very kind in the house. He’s
simply original.”</p>

<p>“There are hundreds of men in the country with
his original ways who are spending their days in lunatic
asylums,” murmured Bart, whose feelings had
changed greatly. He escorted Elsie to the house, Doctor
Lincoln following them at a distance, and giving
them a chance to talk quite freely. Bart found that
he had suspected Frank without the least cause, and
he saw that his jealousy was groundless and foolish
as far as he had thought Frank meant to turn to Elsie
again.</p>

<p>But still within him was the feeling that Elsie still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cared for Merry, and that was gall and wormwood to
him. He longed to tell her everything, but resolved
to see Frank and talk with him again before doing so.
Just then Hodge fancied that he was in need of advice,
and who was better able to advise him than
Frank?</p>

<p>Elsie told Bart that Mrs. Parker had asked the doctor
to have a house-party of college men and young
ladies at Whitney Hill, and he had agreed.</p>

<p>“The invitations are to go out to-morrow,” she said.
“We’ll have a delightful time. Oh, if Inza were here!”</p>

<p>Bart wondered if she felt no jealousy of Inza.</p>

<p>Having bade Elsie adieu, and waved his hand to the
doctor, who returned the salute, Bart turned his face
toward the city.</p>

<p>The fever had left his veins, and his heart was beating
in its usual manner as he swung along. But he
was ashamed of himself on account of the bitter things
that had filled his mind in regard to Frank, and he
resolved to make a confession and ask pardon.</p>

<p>His love for Elsie was more intense than ever.
While he thought of her, visions of the strange, uncanny
doctor kept obtruding upon him. He saw the
man standing there in the woods, big, thick, muscular,
staring at the huge stone at his feet. He seemed
harmless enough, but Bart was firm in his conviction
that such queer characters were dangerous, and should
be watched. This being the case, he could not help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
feeling uneasy about Elsie as long as she remained at
Whitney Hill.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk when Bart came swinging
down Whitney Avenue. He did not look like the
same person who had rushed madly and blackly out
of town a while before. His face wore such a pleasant
look that he was positively handsome.</p>

<p>Some children had been playing a game of tag.
One of them fell and was hurt. Bart stopped, picked
up the child, wiped away its tears, soothed it to laughter,
and left it with a quarter clasped in its soiled
fingers.</p>

<p>Straight to Frank, Bart went. He found Merry in
his room, writing steadily, manuscript scattered about.
Often, of late, Bart had found him thus employed, and
he wondered somewhat what the nature of Frank’s
work could be.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Hodge?” Frank asked.
“I’ve tried in vain to find you.”</p>

<p>“Have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I wished to tell you something.”</p>

<p>“About&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Elsie&mdash;she is here.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“You have seen her?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, without shielding himself in the least, Bart
told Frank how he had seen him helping Elsie onto
the car, and how he had fancied all sorts of bad things
about him. Hodge’s face was flushed with shame as
he proceeded. Several times Merriwell tried to check
him, seeing that this confession was causing him great
humiliation and distress, but the penitent fellow would
not desist until he had finished.</p>

<p>When it was finished they stood there, Frank looking
straight at the dark-faced lad, whose eyes were on
the floor. The silence caused Hodge to look up.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you, Merriwell!” he exclaimed. “I
don’t blame you for despising me! I’m a bad fellow
to think such things of you, after all you have done
for me!”</p>

<p>“It’s not that I am thinking, Hodge,” said Frank
gently. “I am thinking of the great change in you
since the days when we first met. Then you would
not have confessed you were wrong if you had committed
a crime; now you are eager to confess, when
you have no more than thought wrong of me.”</p>

<p>“That was a crime! How could I think wrong of
you after all you have done?”</p>

<p>“What have I done? We have been friends, and
I’m sure you’ve done as much for me as I ever did
for you.”</p>

<p>“No, no!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“You saved my life. You dragged me from the
burning hotel.”</p>

<p>“You have done a thousand times more than that
for me. You have saved me from dishonor and disgrace.
You have saved me from going wrong and
becoming a dissolute reprobate. All that I am and
all that I hope to be I owe to you! Yet I could hold
hatred for you in my heart this day! Oh, Merriwell,
the shame of it is too much to bear!”</p>

<p>He shook with the intensity of his emotion, covering
his drawn face with his hands. Quickly Frank advanced
to his side, and his arm went across Bart’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>“You think too badly of yourself, old man,” declared
Frank. “You were jealous, and jealousy has
parted the truest friends.”</p>

<p>Bart turned and caught hold of Merry.</p>

<p>“But it shall not part us!” he cried fiercely. “Say
it shall not part us, Frank!”</p>

<p>“I hope not, Bart. We will not permit it.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Such friendship as ours comes but once
in a lifetime! Once lost, nothing can ever take its
place.”</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>“That is true,” he said. “I think there is no danger,
Bart.”</p>

<p>“But can you feel just the same toward me after&mdash;after
this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just the same, old man? If anything, I must think
more of you. You might have hidden it from me,
and I’d never been the wiser.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t! Had I thought such things
wrongly of any one else, I’d never confessed it; but
of you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand, Bart. You had no reason to be jealous,
for you know I am engaged to Inza.”</p>

<p>“Elsie does not know?”</p>

<p>“Because you have not told her, after asking the
privilege to do so. I should have let her know it
long ago but for that. Bart, you must tell her. It
is not treating her right to keep it from her.”</p>

<p>Then Hodge confessed why he had not told her before&mdash;confessed
that he feared she still cared for
Merry.</p>

<p>“I hope you are not right, Bart. Something tells
me that you are not. But you know it is possible that
she believed she would be doing me an injustice if
she learned to care more for another, and Elsie would
not, to save her life, do anything she thought wrong.
The safest way, Bart, is to tell her everything. If
you will not, you must let me do it.”</p>

<p>“I will!” said Hodge resolutely. “There is to be
a party out there, given for Elsie, and we’ll receive
invitations to-morrow. At that party, I’ll find a way
to tell her, Frank.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PARTY.</span></h2>


<p>“There are lots of joy forever here this evening,”
observed Jack Ready, as he surveyed the assembly of
pretty girls and manly youths. “In fact, it’s been a
long time since I’ve had the pleasure of looking on
such a fine collection of joy forever.”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to get off?” asked Bert Dashleigh,
who for once was unaccompanied by his mandolin,
which made him feel very lonesome, although
every one else was well satisfied. “What are joys
forever?”</p>

<p>“Things of beauty, of course,” explained Jack, with
an expression of contempt. “My callow young friend,
it is barely possible that you have heard it said that a
‘thing of beauty is a joy forever.’”</p>

<p>“I believe I have,” faltered Bert.</p>

<p>“Well, just take a look at those stunning girls.
Aren’t they things of beauty? Then, of course, they
are joys forever. Where do you get off?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere,” muttered Bert meekly. “You have
such flowery ways of saying things that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That will do!” said Jack loftily. “It is plain you
belong to the common herd that does not understand
the poetic feelings of those who soar to heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
heights. By Jove! there is Jennie Dwight! I wonder
if she will lend me her chewing-gum.” And away he
went in pursuit of a vivacious-looking girl.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the party at Whitney Hill, and
Doctor Lincoln’s handsome residence was thronged
with beautiful girls and bright-looking young men.
From basement to attic the mansion was glittering
with lights, and the sound of music and laughter and
chattering voices seemed to come from every part of it.</p>

<p>Elsie was happy. Of course, she had been compelled
to meet scores of strangers when she would have
preferred to be enjoying herself with a group of her
own particular friends, but all were kind and pleasant,
and a spirit of good-fellowship seemed to pervade
the gathering.</p>

<p>Never in her life had Elsie looked more attractive.
Her dress was of some gray-silk substance, made over
pink, which gave it a delicate tint that seemed to match
her complexion perfectly. Her eyes were blue as the
summer sky, and shining like stars, while the smile
that flitted about her sweet mouth made it seem
sweeter than usual.</p>

<p>The heart of Bart Hodge had given one great throb
when his eyes rested upon her.</p>

<p>“How beautiful she is!” he inwardly cried.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, with a pressure that thrilled
his every nerve. The hot blood was in his cheeks, and
she saw the love-light flame deep in his intense eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
She knew how much he cared for her, and his love was
something that made her afraid at times, for not yet
did she understand her own heart.</p>

<p>Frank came. He was splendid, and he had a way of
saying something pleasant in a manner that did not
seem prosaically conventional. Pretty girls flocked
round him, and he showed that he was one of those
rare men who, while in every way a “man’s man,”
could be quite at his ease in the presence of the other
sex.</p>

<p>It was a perfect spring evening, so warm that the
windows were thrown open and many of the guests
sought the breeze that could be found on the broad
veranda. Out there Chinese lanterns dangled and
glowed, and the throng strolled beneath them.</p>

<p>Somewhere behind a screen of palms and flowers an
orchestra gave forth sweet music. The heroes of Yale,
the gridiron gladiator, the baseball man, the hammer-thrower,
the sprinter, and others who had done things,
were in great demand by the pretty girls.</p>

<p>But of all the heroes present Frank Merriwell was
the most popular. The girls crowded to get a look
at him, to speak to him, to hear his voice and receive
a smile from him.</p>

<p>“He is it!” declared Jack Ready. “He has the call
in this little game. I don’t know another fellow who
wouldn’t look a little foolish or self-conscious. He
doesn’t seem to know that he’s just about the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
blooming show. That makes him all the more popular.
I am for boycotting him.”</p>

<p>“Boycott him!” growled Browning. “He’ll be girl-caught
if he doesn’t look out. There isn’t a pretty girl
here who doesn’t stand ready to fling herself at his
head on the slightest provocation.”</p>

<p>“But what sort of a show do we stand?” sighed
Ready sadly. “All the girls seem to want to talk
about Merriwell, Merriwell, Merriwell. I just told a
saucy young miss that I thought him perfectly horrid.
She gave me the icy eye at once. Bet a button
she won’t know me the next time we meet.”</p>

<p>“You should know better. You’re old enough.”</p>

<p>“But I’d like to be a little bit of a tin hero to somebody,”
the queer sophomore sobbed. “I’m going to
do something. I have made up my mind <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'to do someting'">to do something</ins>
to produce notice. What would you advise?”</p>

<p>“Shoot yourself,” said Bruce gravely. “You’ll get
an obituary notice.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” retorted Jack. “I am not seeking posthumous
glory, my wise friend. I don’t know of anything
I have less use for. I want to do something
that will make a lot of stunning girls cuddle round
me like flies around a molasses-barrel. Now, if I could
only take part in a duel!”</p>

<p>“You will ‘duel’ to avoid such a method of obtaining
glory,” said Bruce.</p>

<p>Jack gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Air!” he moaned faintly.</p>

<p>“That’s all anybody finds in your vicinity,” said
Bruce, moving away.</p>

<p>Next to Merriwell, Dick Starbright seemed the most
popular with the girls. The handsome freshman giant
had won his spurs on the football-field. Having the
build of a Spartan gladiator, the rosy face of a boy,
and the pleasant manners of a Yale gentleman, it was
not strange that he should find himself almost constantly
the center of a bevy of handsome girls. And
he knew what it meant when, in a careless, apparently
thoughtless, manner, some of them rested their hands
on his arm for a moment. They wanted to feel his
muscle!</p>

<p>Hodge might have had a flock around him, but he
was so dark and stern that they seemed a little afraid
of him. When they gathered near, he did not seem
to mind them. There was only one girl among them
all for Bart, and he was impatiently waiting the time
when she would be at liberty to give him some of her
attention.</p>

<p>Doctor Lincoln seemed very happy. His heavy face
wore a smile, but Bart fancied the wild light lurked in
his eyes. The doctor found Hodge and drew him aside.</p>

<p>“I have been listening to the talk,” he said. “I
have heard these young people speaking of Merriwell
as such a wonder. And Starbright&mdash;they seem to
think he is very strong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is,” said Bart.</p>

<p>“I presume so&mdash;in a way. He is big, and, of course,
he must have a certain amount of strength. But he
is not what I rate as truly strong.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Do you think he could lift that stone
out there in the grove?”</p>

<p>“He might.”</p>

<p>The doctor frowned.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he might, but I doubt it. I am certain
Merriwell could not lift it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too certain. Frank Merriwell is far
stronger than he looks. I fancy, if put to the test,
he’d be able to show himself even stronger than Starbright.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that?” exclaimed the doctor, in apparent
surprise. “Well, you know them both, and
you may be right. But how I could astonish them.
They do not know that I am the strongest man in the
world, do they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they do.”</p>

<p>Somehow, this answer seemed to arouse the man’s
suspicions.</p>

<p>“Have you betrayed my secret?” he whispered
rather fiercely. “You promised that you would not.
Have you told them that I am the strongest man in
the world?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The man seemed to draw a breath of relief.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you had done so,” he said. “You
must keep my secret. You must not breathe it to a
soul. I don’t know why I trusted you. It was foolish
of me.”</p>

<p>Bart said nothing.</p>

<p>“You took me by surprise,” declared the strange
doctor. “You were watching me there in the grove.
Why were you watching me? Answer that question.”</p>

<p>“It happened quite by chance.”</p>

<p>“Did it? Then you were not spying upon me?”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps you might have been. I have
kept the great secret until the time comes to divulge
it, which I shall do in a most sensational manner. I
have not yet decided how it is to be, but I shall do
something to rival the act of Samson when he pulled
down the temple upon his enemies. I have enemies.
You may not know it, but it is true. I have secret
enemies, and they would rob me of my strength if
they knew I possessed it. That is why I wish to keep
it a secret until the time comes. Then I shall call
them all out in a body and topple some massive building
down upon them. That will obliterate them, and
they will give me no more trouble.”</p>

<p>He was speaking in a quiet tone of voice, and any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
one observing him must have fancied he was simply
chatting with Bart about ordinary matters.</p>

<p>More than ever was Hodge satisfied that the man
was a dangerous lunatic. And he was all the more
dangerous because he had craftily concealed from
those who knew him best the fact of his derangement.
They simply thought him “queer,” but it was not
likely that any of them dreamed that his mind was actually
unbalanced.</p>

<p>“When the time comes,” the doctor continued, “I
may ask you to assist me in calling my enemies together.
Oh, I’ll show you some sport! You love
sport, and you’ll laugh at this, I promise you. We
will get them to stand in one long row, and then I’ll
bring the bricks and mortar and stone and iron thundering
down upon them. It will be just like children
playing with blocks.”</p>

<p>The doctor laughed silently to himself as he thought
of this, and Bart felt a cold shiver creeping over him.</p>

<p>“I must tell Elsie everything,” he thought. “She
must not remain in the house with this madman.”</p>

<p>Then he saw her coming toward them.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, doctor,” he said. “I wish to have a
chat with Miss Bellwood.”</p>

<p>“But not a word of the great secret to her!” warned
the man, in a whisper. “If you value your life, be
silent!”</p>

<span class="fs70">FOR ELSIE.</span></h2>


<p>“Elsie.”</p>

<p>She stopped and turned as she heard her name
spoken. Mrs. Parker approached, accompanied by a
young man, whom she introduced.</p>

<p>It was Gene Skelding.</p>

<p>“The dancing is about to begin,” said Mrs. Parker.
“Gene is my nephew, Elsie.”</p>

<p>Then, in a very clever manner, she practically asked
Elsie to give Gene Skelding the first waltz.</p>

<p>Now, Elsie did not care to dance with Skelding,
but she could not refuse under the circumstances, and
Bart Hodge was filled with dismay, chagrin, and
anger when he saw the fellow bear Elsie away toward
the drawing-room on his arm. She glanced back over
her shoulder, but he had seen her turn, and he pretended
to be deeply interested in another direction.</p>

<p>This was a disappointment to Elsie, for she had intended
to indicate to him by a look that she was not
pleased with the arrangement, which she had been
unable to avoid.</p>

<p>Skelding was triumphant. For a long time he had
admired Elsie Bellwood, but, being outside Merriwell’s
set, he had not succeeded in making her acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>When he chose, Skelding could converse pleasantly,
and he exerted himself just now to be agreeable. In
fact, he exerted himself so much that he came near
overdoing it.</p>

<p>When they reached the drawing-room, the dancing
had begun. It was with great satisfaction that Shielding
glided onto the floor with Elsie, brushing past
Frank Merriwell, who was still surrounded by several
pretty girls.</p>

<p>Gene knew Merriwell had paid Elsie great attentions
in the past, and it was his belief that Frank still
cared for her. Therefore, he regarded the securing of
the first waltz with her as a very clever thing on his
part.</p>

<p>Frank saw Elsie with Skelding, and he was astonished,
for he did not know the fellow was Mrs. Parker’s
nephew, and he wondered how he had obtained
her for that dance.</p>

<p>A sudden fear came to Frank. Was it possible that
Elsie did not care for Bart, and had taken particular
pains to avoid him, giving this dance to another for
the purpose of causing him pain? No, he could not
think that of her. Elsie was not the girl to deliberately
give pain to any one she regarded as her true friend.</p>

<p>But perhaps she really did wish to avoid Bart. Perhaps
she considered this as the best way of showing
him what her wishes were. If she did not care for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Bart&mdash;what then? Frank remembered the past, and
it gave him no little uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t Hodge told her of my engagement to
Inza?” he inwardly cried.</p>

<p>Then he realized that he was standing there with
those girls talking to him, yet without understanding
a word they had been saying for the past three minutes.</p>

<p>The college men ventured to come up and bear one
after another of the girls away. Frank selected one,
and was soon in the midst of the waltz.</p>

<p>In vain he looked for Bart. Hodge was not dancing.
Indeed, Bart had withdrawn from the house
to the veranda, where he stood facing the cool breeze
that felt so pleasant on his flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>“Curse that fellow!” he inwardly cried. “Properly,
this is my dance with her. Why did she give it to
him?”</p>

<p>He longed to throttle Skelding. The fact that Elsie
was waltzing with a member of the despicable Chickering
set caused him to grind his teeth in rage. He
felt a touch on the arm.</p>

<p>“You did not decide to dance?”</p>

<p>It was the voice of the doctor.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Hodge shortly.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful evening.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Bart did not feel inclined to talk just then, but the
doctor lingered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you are not going to dance, what do you say
to a stroll?”</p>

<p>Now, Hodge had no fancy for taking a stroll with
this man just then, and he politely declined.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I might be able to tell you some things
of interest,” suggested the doctor, in a low voice.
“You know I have a secret. Wouldn’t you like to be
able to acquire marvelous strength?”</p>

<p>“I am quite satisfied with my strength.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” asked the man, as if he really pitied
the poor fellow. “That is because you do not know
what you are missing. You do not know what it is
to feel that you are able to move a mountain if you
wish. That is living! It goes all through you.”</p>

<p>Bart turned away. The talk of this lunatic wearied
him.</p>

<p>“If you will come to the lodge in the grove,” whispered
the doctor, “I’ll reveal to you my wonderful
secret. Think of it! I have never before made such
an offer to any living human being. I will show
you how you may become strong like me.”</p>

<p>“Why should you do this?”</p>

<p>“Because I have taken a fancy to you. Come,
come!”</p>

<p>He seized Bart’s arm as if he would force him from
the house toward the grove near at hand.</p>

<p>“Stop!” said Bart sternly. “Let go, sir! I will not
go with you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The man’s eyes seemed to gleam at him balefully
through the gloom, and it was plain that he was hesitating.
Hodge nerved himself for the struggle, in case
he was attacked. But the attack did not come. The
doctor’s hand fell from the arm of the student, and
he laughed softly.</p>

<p>“You are the first man I ever offered to give a part
of my great secret,” he said, “and you have refused
to accept it! I did not expect it of you! My confidence
in you has been misplaced, but again I warn
you to be silent. If you betray me, it will cost you
your life!”</p>

<p>Then he turned and left the veranda, walking rapidly
away into the darkness. Hodge gave himself a
shake.</p>

<p>“The man means me harm!” he decided. “I feel
that he wished to get me away from the house for
no good purpose. He is dangerous, and Elsie must
not remain beneath this roof!”</p>

<p>Then he thought of Elsie waltzing with Skelding and
ground his teeth again.</p>

<p>“Why did she accept him for that waltz? She
knew I was waiting for her! Can it be that she wishes
to stand me off?”</p>

<p>The thought filled him with intense anguish, so that
beads of cold perspiration started out upon his face.
The music stopped. The waltz was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll keep out of the way for a time,” he decided.
“I am in no mood to be seen now.”</p>

<p>Some of the dancers came out onto the veranda,
where they could chat, but Bart remained in a dark
corner. Everybody seemed happy, and he was most
miserable.</p>

<p>After a time a little group of students gathered near
him and lighted their cigarettes. He saw their faces
by the flash of the match, and an exclamation nearly
escaped his lips as he observed that Skelding was one
of them.</p>

<p>“Never enjoyed a waltz so much in my life, fellows,”
declared Gene. “Didn’t I have a queen?”</p>

<p>“She’s Merriwell’s best,” said somebody. “Look
out, or you’ll get tangled up with him.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell be hanged! I don’t care for him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but still, he’s bad medicine. She is
a queen, though.”</p>

<p>“Fellows, she’s a peach of a waltzer,” declared
Gene, while Hodge began to tremble in every limb.</p>

<p>“You must be struck on her,” chuckled one of the
others.</p>

<p>“I’m hard hit. I wouldn’t mind winning her for
keeps.”</p>

<p>“You can’t win her away from Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“I got the first waltz with her.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was something; but he’ll waltz with her
oftener than you do to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll go the fizz for the crowd that he doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Done!”</p>

<p>By this time Bart was furious. His hands were
opening and closing nervously, and it seemed that his
hoarse breathing must be heard by the group of students.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is going to be easy!” laughed Skelding.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. We’ll see how easy it is. I saw
Merriwell watching you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that. Made him jealous. Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“You seem to think you have a safe thing.”</p>

<p>“Why, fellows, I’ll tell you something: she squeezed
my hand during the waltz.”</p>

<p>“You’re a miserable liar and a cur!” said Bart
Hodge, as he stepped into the midst of the group and
confronted Skelding.</p>

<p>Before Gene could get out of the way or lift his
hand, Hodge seized him by the nose, which he gave
a pull that brought a cry of pain from the fellow’s
lips.</p>

<p>Then the two were thrust apart. Gene had clasped
his nose with both hands. Beneath his feet his cigarette
spluttered sparks and went out. Somebody
laughed beyond an open window.</p>

<p>“Curse you!” hoarsely breathed Skelding. “You
shall pay for this!”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” said Bart grimly.</p>

<p>“Now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“The sooner the better!”</p>

<p>“Follow me.”</p>

<p>“Lead on.”</p>

<p>Some of the others tried to interfere and prevent the
fight for the time, but such a thing could not be
averted. They left the piazza and moved away from
the house toward the lake. Bart did not seek the
companionship of friends. The men whom Gene had
been speaking to thus lightly about Elsie went along.</p>

<p>They found a quiet spot at a distance from the
house, yet within hearing of the music and laughter.
The orchestra had started up again, and the happy
throng in the house was dancing.</p>

<p>Hodge was eager to get at Skelding. He boiled to
teach the cheap fellow a lesson. That any one had
dared speak in such a manner of Elsie was enough to
make him furious.</p>

<p>They stripped off their coats and vests. They even
removed collars, neckties, and white shirts.</p>

<p>Skelding’s friends helped him prepare. Bart disdained
help. Hodge fastened his suspenders about his
waist to support his trousers. He was ready first.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you sorry for what you did!” vowed
Skelding.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you swallow your lying words, or I’ll
kill you!” declared Bart, in a low, terrible voice.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“I am waiting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>They stepped quickly toward each other. In a moment
they were at it.</p>

<p>It was not light enough for them to see to fight in a
scientific manner. Hodge pressed the fighting from
the very start. Skelding had tried to do this, but he
found Bart a perfect whirlwind, flying about him here,
there, everywhere, hitting him on one side and then
on the other.</p>

<p>The spectators watched in great excitement. It was
a fierce fight, and they knew it could not last long.
Suddenly one of the men went down before a blow
that sounded like a pistol-shot.</p>

<p>It was Skelding. Bart stood over him, panting.</p>

<p>“Get up! Get up and let me finish you! I’ve not
begun to give you what you deserve!”</p>

<p>Skelding was ready enough to get up. He did so as
soon as he could, meeting Bart’s rush in the best form
he could command.</p>

<p>But the blows rained on Gene’s face. He felt the
blood flowing, and he panted and staggered. What
made him feel the worst was that he could not seem
to reach Hodge with a single good blow.</p>

<p>Bart was fighting for the honor of Elsie, and it
made him a thousand times more terrible than usual.
Indeed, it was a wonder that Gene stood up before
him as long as he did.</p>

<p>At last, however, Skelding went down again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
again before those terrible fists. He could not stand
in front of them at all, and he was very “groggy.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, Hodge!” exclaimed one of the spectators.
“You have given him punishment enough!”</p>

<p>“Keep back!” commanded Bart, in an awesome
voice.</p>

<p>“But I say it’s enough!”</p>

<p>“If you interfere, you’ll have to fight, also!”</p>

<p>“Do you want to kill the man?”</p>

<p>“If he does not swallow his lying words, I shall
never stop till he is dead or unconscious!”</p>

<p>He meant it, and Skelding knew it. He knew that
he could not endure such fearful punishment much
longer, and yet he hated to give up.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you devil!” he almost sobbed, his heart filled
with shame and anger.</p>

<p>“You lied about her, Skelding! You know it, and
I know it. Take back those words!”</p>

<p>“I will not!”</p>

<p>Crack&mdash;down Gene went.</p>

<p>Bart waited for him to rise, and he got up slowly.</p>

<p>“Take back those words!”</p>

<p>“I refuse!”</p>

<p>Crack&mdash;it was repeated.</p>

<p>Again, after a pause, Skelding dragged himself up.</p>

<p>“Take back those words!”</p>

<p>“No, I will&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Crack&mdash;a third time he went down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The men who were watching did not dare interfere.
Skelding dragged himself to his elbow, but did
not try to rise.</p>

<p>“You can’t make me take them back!” he said
thickly.</p>

<p>Bart dropped to one knee, grasped the fellow by the
neck, and lifted his terrible fist.</p>

<p>“Take them back,” he said, “or I’ll disfigure you for
life! I’ll never stop till you swallow those words!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I will take them back!” faltered the beaten fellow,
his nerve failing him at last.</p>

<p>“Confess that you lied!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I lied; I confess it!”</p>

<p>“That’s all!” said Bart, rising. “But if you ever
speak her name again, and I know of it, I’ll give you
worse than anything you have received to-night!”</p>

<p>Then he removed his suspenders from about his
waist, found his clothes, and began to dress, his manner
seeming so cool that the witnesses of the fight
wondered. A short time after, Bart sauntered slowly
up to the house, as if he had simply been out for a
little stroll.</p>

<p>As he mounted the steps to the veranda, some one
uttered a little exclamation of pleasure, and came toward
him through the shadows. Then Elsie was before
him, and her hands were on his arm.</p>

<p>“I’ve been searching for you everywhere, Bart,” she
declared. “Where in the world have you been?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, just wandering round the grounds,” he answered.</p>

<p>“You did not dance.”</p>

<p>“Without you!” His voice was full of tender reproach.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bart! I couldn’t help it,” she told him. “Mrs.
Parker asked me to dance with him that time, and how
could I refuse?”</p>

<p>“Why was she so anxious?”</p>

<p>“He is her nephew.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Bart; but that was all
he said, though he was thinking that Mrs. Parker
might not recognize her nephew if she could see him
just then.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you would not understand,” said Elsie.
“You see what an awkward position I was in. I
didn’t have enough wit to tell a fib and say I had
promised you.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you did not tell a fib, Elsie. Even a
white fib would seem out of place on your lips.”</p>

<p>“But were you angry with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bart!”</p>

<p>“I was as angry as a&mdash;as a&mdash;as a fool!” he said.
“I couldn’t help it! I even thought of leaving without
a word, and going back to town.”</p>

<p>She uttered a little cry.</p>

<p>“I am so glad you did not!” she whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you really glad, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“Really and truly, Bart.”</p>

<p>“Have you been dancing again?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I was searching for you. Somebody asked me to
dance, but I refused him.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?”</p>

<p>“Frank.”</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Hodge almost choked.</p>

<p>“You refused to dance with Frank?” he said huskily.
“All because you had not danced with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bart,” she whispered, and he felt her hands
trembling.</p>

<p>He found those hands and imprisoned them both,
all the great love in his heart surging up to his lips
and seeking to be outpoured at once.</p>

<p>“Elsie, my sweetheart! You are&mdash;I feel it! I know
it! And a little while ago I thought you did not care&mdash;I
thought you wished to show me that you did not
care, and that I was nothing to you!”</p>

<p>“How could you think such mean things of me,
Bart?”</p>

<p>“I did not want to think them, God knows! but
they would come into my head.”</p>

<p>The music was some simple little love-song, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
came sweetly to their ears. It seemed to be particularly
adapted to the moment, and ever after, through
all their lives, that tune was the sweetest of all tunes
to them.</p>

<p>“Elsie, you do love me&mdash;you do?”</p>

<p>She did not answer in words, but her hands were
clasped in his, and he received a pressure that told him
much. And only a short time before he had fought
another man for claiming to receive such a pressure
from those dear hands.</p>

<p>He would have kissed her then and there, but a
strolling couple approached along the veranda.</p>

<p>“Let’s take a little walk through the grounds,” he
suggested. “It is warm. Will you need a wrap?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more than this I have about my shoulders,”
she answered.</p>

<p>They descended the steps and moved away along
a walk. Up from a spot near where they had been
rose a dark shadow, like a thing of evil, and stole silently
after them.</p>

<span class="fs70">A FIGHT WITH A MANIAC.</span></h2>


<p>Frank had been unable to find either Hodge or
Elsie for some time. He wondered what had become
of them, and the fancy came to him that perhaps Bart
had met her and was improving the opportunity to unbosom
himself.</p>

<p>“I hope he has,” thought Merry; “and I hope she accepts
him. He is a truly splendid fellow! Not many
chaps would have made the confession he did to me
yesterday.”</p>

<p>At last Frank left the house and started alone for a
stroll about the grounds. He was weary of being
lionized, and he wished to get away by himself. At
the farther extremity of the grounds, he paused, hearing
some one running swiftly toward him, panting and
sobbing as she came, for the sound was like that of a
woman.</p>

<p>This person ran almost into Frank’s arms. She
saw him, caught her foot, and nearly fell. His strong
arm kept her from going down.</p>

<p>“Help!” she gasped, in the greatest terror, clasping
his arm. “Bring somebody to help him!”</p>

<p>“Elsie!” he exclaimed. “What has happened? Tell
me everything! Tell me quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Frank!” she gasped, being almost too exhausted
to speak. “Bart&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What has happened to Bart?”</p>

<p>“He told me&mdash;all about Doctor Lincoln. And then&mdash;while
we were talking&mdash;the doctor came right upon
us. He seized Bart, and they had a terrible struggle.
I tried to help Bart, but he thrust me off. Then I
saw him strike Bart with something, and Bart fell.
He has&mdash;carried him off&mdash;into the grove!”</p>

<p>Now Frank was stirred.</p>

<p>“Where did this happen, Elsie? Tell me if you
cannot show me! I must do what I can to save him.”</p>

<p>She had confidence in Frank; she believed Frank
could save him. Her strength seemed to come back,
and she started away, crying:</p>

<p>“Follow me; I’ll show you!”</p>

<p>She ran again, and he followed her. At a distant
part of the grounds, not far from the edge of the
grove, she showed him the spot where the encounter
had taken place.</p>

<p>“And he carried Bart off toward the grove?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>The grove looked dark and gloomy, but Merriwell
bounded toward it at once. Hodge had told him of the
lodge in the midst of that grove, and he felt that the
maniac had carried Bart to that.</p>

<p>Frank was right. Having struck Hodge down
with an instrument that rendered Bart helpless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
unable to resist, the man caught him up in his powerful
arms and rushed straight toward the lodge in the
midst of the grove. Knowing every foot of the way,
he bore the unfortunate college man straight there.</p>

<p>The door opened before the touch of the doctor,
and he carried his intended victim into the hut. When
they were inside, the doctor touched a button, and
electric lights flashed up.</p>

<p>Hodge was conscious now, and he tried to make another
struggle. The man caught him by the neck, and
it seemed that those iron fingers would crush flesh,
sinew, and bone. There was a frightful glare in the
eyes of the mad doctor.</p>

<p>“I trusted you,” he said in a terrible voice, “and you
betrayed my secret! For that you shall die!”</p>

<p>The struggle did not last long, and Bart was hurled
into a big chair with arms. Then the doctor held him
there, binding his limbs with cords and tying him
fast.</p>

<p>Hodge felt like shrieking for help, but he knew that
would be folly, and he made no cry. Instead, he tried
to think of some method of appeasing the maniac.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you made a mistake, doctor?” he said in
a voice that possessed all the calmness he could command.</p>

<p>“No!” roared the madman. “You know I have
made no mistake! You are the traitor!”</p>

<p>“Did you hear correctly, doctor? I did not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will do you no good to lie! You have betrayed
me, and you must die!”</p>

<p>“I was speaking to Miss Bellwood when you pounced
upon me.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you had told her that I thought myself the
strongest man in the world. Thought! Ha, ha, ha!
Why, I know! You were like a child in my hands!
Did you see how weak and helpless you were? Yet
I’ll wager that you think you are strong. You thought
you were strong when you fought with Skelding a
while ago.”</p>

<p>“You know of that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I know of it. I have been watching you
for a long time, as something told me you would
betray me. You thought you were strong because
you could conquer him. Bah! I could have stepped
in and handled you both without an effort. I could
have toyed with you. It would have given me pleasure
to do so, but I did not care to betray my great
strength to those others who were present. That was
why I stood off and waited.”</p>

<p>So this maniac had been following him round all
the evening? The thought was hardly agreeable.</p>

<p>“Something told me you would give away my secret,”
went on the mad doctor, his eyes dancing. “That
was why I clung so close to you. When I hear that
voice whispering something in my ear, I know it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
speaks the truth. It whispered over and over: ‘He is
a traitor! He is a traitor!’ But you lied to her!”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“You told her that I am mad. Poor fool! Why
should you think anything so ridiculous? You did
it because you were jealous. I can read you. You
did not wish the world to ever know that I am the
strongest man alive. Why, you idiot! did you think
they could take me and confine me in an asylum?
Why, you must have known that I can bend and break
the strongest iron bars! You must have known that
I could pull the walls down. There are no walls
strong enough to hold me.”</p>

<p>“I think you are right,” said Bart.</p>

<p>“I know I am!”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you proclaim your wonderful
strength to the world?”</p>

<p>“The time has not come.”</p>

<p>“This is a good time to do it. Why wait so long?
To-morrow you can astonish the whole world.”</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am not quite ready.”</p>

<p>“But your enemies&mdash;you wish to obliterate them,
and I am to help you. I will get them together to-morrow,
and you may topple those heavy buildings
upon them.”</p>

<p>“You can’t fool me!” laughed the maniac, with a
cunning leer. “I know your game!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“You proposed it yourself. You suggested that I
was to help you.”</p>

<p>“But then I thought you all right. Now I know
you are a traitor. You would not help me.”</p>

<p>“If I promise&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will accept no promise from you. A man who
has been false once will be false again. You must
die!”</p>

<p>Bart began to realize that he could not deceive the
maniac in such a manner; but he was thinking that
Elsie had rushed away for aid, and this talk might
give her time to bring help. So Bart went on talking.
After a time, however, the doctor seemed to suspect
his purpose.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” he grinned, as he went to a closet in
the wall, from which he took a long black knife. “I
know what you are trying to do, but there is no hope
for you. They will not come to your aid. And even
if they did, what could they all do against me? Why,
I could handle them like a giant among children.”</p>

<p>He was feeling of the edge of the knife with his
thumb.</p>

<p>“It is sharp,” he nodded. “One slash of this will do
the work, and I shall be stronger when it is over, for
all your strength will go into my body.”</p>

<p>“Is that how you won your strength?” asked Bart,
still hoping help might appear.</p>

<p>“I’ll not tell you! You have betrayed me, and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
tell you no more. Your time has come! I am going
to make quick work of you. I’ll not torture you.
One strong, swift stroke, and the knife will finish you.
Brace up, now. You’re white. Show that you are
not a coward.”</p>

<p>Bart fancied the door behind the doctor’s back moved
slightly. He fancied it was swinging open.</p>

<p>The maniac bent over Bart and lifted the knife.</p>

<p>Then the door swung back noiselessly, and Frank
Merriwell came into the room, leaping on the back of
the mad doctor, whose wrist he grasped.</p>

<p>Then began one of the most terrible struggles Hodge
had ever witnessed. And Bart was helpless to render
Frank the least assistance. He could only look on and
pray that Merry might conquer this terrible maniac.</p>

<p>Frank knew that it was a life-and-death struggle,
and he exerted his wonderful powers as he had never
before done. The doctor uttered a roar of rage, and
tried to fling the youth off.</p>

<p>“Look out for him, Merry!” panted Bart. “Look
out for that knife!”</p>

<p>Frank was taking care that the man did not get his
knife-hand free. He had jerked the doctor’s hand
back and given it an upward twist behind his back,
hoping to force him to release his hold on the knife;
but the man continued to clutch it for a time.</p>

<p>Higher and higher Frank twisted that arm, on
which the muscles stood out in great ridges. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the fingers relaxed, and the knife slipped to the floor
with a clang.</p>

<p>Bart gave a sigh of relief and hope. But having
released the knife, the mad doctor wrenched about
and fastened his hands on Frank.</p>

<p>The strength of the maniac was appalling, but
against it was pitted the strength and skill of the
cleverest athlete Yale had ever known.</p>

<p>Frank succeeded in tripping the man, but the wall
kept the doctor from going down. The lodge shook
and rocked beneath their fearful struggles. The fact
that he could not handle Merry at once made the
maniac madly furious.</p>

<p>“You fool!” he roared. “Do you think to pit your
puny strength against mine? Why, I am the strongest
man in the world, and I can crush you!”</p>

<p>“Strong!” retorted Frank, with an expression of
contempt. “Why, you are weak as a child! You
could not handle a healthy boy of ten!”</p>

<p>“What?” snarled the doctor, in amazement. “You
know better than that!”</p>

<p>“I am fooling with you now to show you how weak
you really are,” Frank declared. “I can handle you
any time.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” shrieked the doctor, redoubling his efforts.
“I’ll break every bone in your body!”</p>

<p>Then he did his utmost, and a gasp of horror came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
from the lips of Bart, for he saw Merry gradually
forced to his knees, despite his efforts to prevent.</p>

<p>Hodge knew Frank had sought to shake the maniac’s
confidence in his own strength by his words, and now
Bart broke into taunting laughter.</p>

<p>“That’s it, Merriwell!” he cried, as if delighted.
“You can fool him with that trick! He thinks he is
getting the best of you, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Frank had given a sudden, great twist, and the doctor
was flung heavily to the floor. Frank was on top.</p>

<p>The shock was a great surprise to the madman, but
he did not give up. He had fancied he was getting the
best of his antagonist, only to find himself thrown with
a wrestler’s trick.</p>

<p>Here and there over the floor they writhed and
squirmed. With his powerful body, the doctor would
lift Merry more than a foot, but Frank always drove
him back to the floor with a shock that made the
lodge quiver.</p>

<p>How Bart longed to break free and take a hand!
Together they could have conquered the man. But
though he writhed and twisted and strained, the cords
held him fast.</p>

<p>Where was Elsie?</p>

<p>Frank had run on before her, and she was lost somewhere
in the grove, wandering about in search of the
lodge. Had she been there, she might have rendered
assistance just then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sudden flop, a turn. It seemed that
the man had Frank foul at last. He laughed harshly,
and Hodge held his breath.</p>

<p>But Merry rose to one knee, got his feet beneath
him, struggled up despite all attempts to hold him
down, and again they both were on their feet.</p>

<p>“Great work!” exclaimed Bart, in delight. “Now
give him the cross-buttock, Merry!”</p>

<p>Frank did it at the very instant that Bart spoke, but
he got his body far under that of the doctor, whom he
flung fairly over his head. Down came the man with
a terrible crash, his head striking the floor hard.</p>

<p>Merry was on him.</p>

<p>“The strongest man in the world!” laughed Bart.
“Why, he is a kid in your hands, Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“I told him so,” said Frank. “He must be an invalid,
or he could do better than this.”</p>

<p>A groan of disappointment escaped the lips of the
doctor, for at last he realized that this youth had conquered
him; and then, as Frank had hoped, with this
realization all the remarkable strength seemed to go
out of the man, leaving him helpless in Merriwell’s
grasp.</p>

<p>At that moment Elsie appeared at the door and
looked in, having found the lodge at last.</p>

<p>“Just in time!” cried Bart. “Quick, Elsie! take
that knife and cut these cords!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>She staggered a little, but she caught up the knife
and obeyed, setting Hodge free.</p>

<p>“Let me help you, Merry!” panted Bart, as with
some of the cords he bent over the conquered maniac.
“We’ll soon have him tied up in fancy style. Old
man, you put up a dandy fight!”</p>

<p>So they swiftly bound Doctor Lincoln, taking pains
to tie him fast. Frank drew a deep breath when the
job was done.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “of all the men I ever tackled, he
is the most remarkable. At times he seemed to have
the strength of two men, and I did fear that he would
get the best of me.”</p>

<p>A strange look came to the face of the doctor.</p>

<p>“Then you lied when you called me weak!” he
cried, frothing at the mouth. “It was a trick! You
did it to deceive me!”</p>

<p>“That is true,” nodded Frank. “It was necessary
to do something.”</p>

<p>Bart was supporting Elsie.</p>

<p>“Come!” she whispered; “let’s go away. I can’t
stay here! The sight of him terrifies me!”</p>

<p>Hodge supported her from the lodge, saying:</p>

<p>“Come on, Merriwell. He’s secure, and we can
leave him till we can send somebody to take care of
him.”</p>

<p>Frank lingered a little, to make sure the mad doctor’s
bond’s were secure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Bart!” Elsie breathed, when they were alone
outside; “I have suffered such terror, for I thought he
would kill you! Had he done so, it would have killed
me also!”</p>

<p>“Elsie&mdash;Elsie, my sweetheart! Then you do love
me? Tell me that you love me!”</p>

<p>“Bart, I love you&mdash;I love you!”</p>

<p>And so Bart found his happiness as he had wished,
without disclosing to Elsie the fact that Frank Merriwell
and Inza were engaged.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE FIFTEENTH MAN.</span></h2>


<p>The early spring days passed rapidly at the college,
and the interest of the students had been for days
centered in the date fixed for the elections to the
senior societies.</p>

<p>It was five o’clock in the afternoon of the third
Thursday in May. In front of the fence the juniors
had congregated in a body, and there they waited in
solemn and expectant silence. Without doubt, every
man in that throng by the fence hoped deep in his
heart that it would be his fate to make “Bones.”</p>

<p>Some there were who felt confident, and their confidence
showed in their faces; but others were doubtful
and nervous, while still others, knowing that their
chances were not worth reckoning upon, seemed resigned,
as if nothing more than curiosity to watch
the rest had brought them there.</p>

<p>Still all hoped. Often in the past some unexpected
man had been chosen to accept the high honor of entering
one of the three senior societies, and what had
happened might happen again. Of course, there were
men whose election seemed certain. Their society career
had begun in Kappa Omicron Alpha, when they were
at Andover, and had continued triumphantly through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Hé Boulé or Eta Phi, the Yale sophomore societies,
into Delta Kappa Epsilon, Psi Upsilon, or Alpha Delta
Phi, the great junior societies of the college. It would
be against all precedent to leave such men out of all
three of the senior societies, and of course they felt
certain that the hand of some searching senior society
man would fall smartly on their backs that day.</p>

<p>But out of that throng of students only forty-five
men could be the favored ones, fifteen to each society.
The confident ones were all looking to make “Bones,”
though, to tell the truth, there was some inward trepidation
among them.</p>

<p>For Skull and Bones is the great senior society at
Yale, being the oldest and richest of them all. He is
not a Yale man who would prefer scholarship, honors,
or prizes to membership in this society, and it is supposed
that the honor falls each year to the fifteen
men who stand highest as scholars, athletes, or have
made brilliant records in a literary and social way.</p>

<p>Next to “Bones” comes Scroll and Key, generally
known as “Keys,” and, after “Bones,” it gets the
cream of the picking. If a man does not make “Bones,”
he may feel solaced and satisfied that his great ambitions
have not been entirely fruitless in case he is
taken into “Keys.” Indeed, the men who make the
latter society seem to convince themselves that it is
the one they always preferred, and they bear themselves
with the air and dignity of conquerors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>And so on this third Thursday in May all the
probable and possible candidates were gathered at the
fence. Freshmen and sophomores stood off and looked
on, for in this ceremony they had no part.</p>

<p>In less than one minute after the clock struck five, a
solemn senior was seen threading his way through the
crowd, and all knew a “Bones” man was in search of
the candidate he had been sent to notify. All eyes
followed him, and an anxious hush fell on the great
throng.</p>

<p>“It’s Gunnison!” whispered somebody, as the
searcher was seen looking sharply at a man.</p>

<p>“No, Rice!” fluttered another. “See, he’s turned
away from Gunnison.”</p>

<p>But he passed Rice.</p>

<p>“Who can it be?”</p>

<p>In a moment they would know. Of a sudden, the
searcher dealt a student a sharp slap on the back,
sternly saying:</p>

<p>“Go to your room!”</p>

<p>“It’s Gildea!” said a voice that was drowned in a
great shout that goes up from the spectators.</p>

<p>The first “Bones” man had been chosen.</p>

<p>Then came another grave senior weaving in and
out through the throng, and soon another shout went
up as another man was tapped sharply on the back
and ordered to go to his room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The watchers were keeping count with untold excitement
and anxiety, for thus they could tell where
each man went and how their own chances were growing
less, in case they were juniors.</p>

<p>Bertrand Defarge was smiling and serene, for he
had made a sophomore and a junior society, and he
was confident of being taken into the field of “Bones.”</p>

<p>At one time he had feared, but since that time he
had made his peace with Merriwell. It had been a
terrible humiliation for him to go to Frank and humble
himself, but the French youth, feeling that his ambition
was hopeless unless he did, had forced himself
to do so. It was the manner in which Merriwell had
met him that restored hope and confidence to the heart
of Defarge, for Frank had seemed glad that he came,
and had appeared to accept in good faith his repentance.</p>

<p>Defarge left Merriwell that night with the firm conviction
that Frank’s one great ambition in life was to
make friends of his enemies. And he told himself
that he had deceived Merry finely with his tearful protestations
of sorrow, repentance, admiration, and
pledges of future friendship. He had seen Merriwell
do much in the past for enemies who had become his
friends, and Bertrand worked to deceive Frank into
giving him a lift toward the goal of his ambitions,
“Bones.” In this he was crafty, knowing that open
speech would not do, but yet he fancied he had managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to convey his meaning and desires in a most delicate
manner.</p>

<p>The fellow had even been so confident that he
boasted of his cleverness to one or two intimate and
confidential friends.</p>

<p>“Merriwell is the easiest fellow in the world to fool
if you know how to go about it,” he had said.</p>

<p>“Do you think that?”</p>

<p>“I know it. I’ve been playing my cards wrong with
him. I’ve just found out the trick.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Make him think you love him. Make him believe
you’re awfully sorry for any harm you may have
tried to do him. Be a repentant sinner, and seek forgiveness.
He loves to forgive. He has a magnanimous
way of saying: ‘Oh, that’s all right, old man;
don’t mention it.’ Then he’ll turn to and do more for
the enemy he believes has become his friend than for
any one else.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p>“His record. Diamond was his enemy; see what he
did for Diamond. Browning was his enemy, and he
has stood ready to do anything for him. Hodge was
one of the bitterest enemies he ever had, yet they are
bosom friends now. Badger, who hated him, finally
turned friend, and Merriwell helped Badger win and
carry off Winnie Lee for his wife. That is proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
enough. I’ve given him the hint, and I know he’ll
throw his influence for me. Not a word, old man, but
I’m sure of making ‘Bones’ now.”</p>

<p>So Defarge stood by the fence and smiled as he
saw man after man tapped and ordered away. He had
little interest in a chap he knew was looking for a
“Keys” candidate, and none whatever in the Wolf’s
Head searcher.</p>

<p>Hock Mason happened to be standing close to Defarge.
Bertrand had sought to be friendly toward all
of Merriwell’s friends after his professed “change
of heart,” and now he was conversing with the youth
from South Carolina.</p>

<p>“Twelve men gone to ‘Bones,’” he said in a low
tone. “That leaves only three more.”</p>

<p>“And I know twenty good fellows who ought to go
there,” said Hock.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; that’s all right; but you see it can’t be, as
only fifteen men can make it.”</p>

<p>“You’re not tapped yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s time enough,” declared Bertrand, but
the confident smile was fading from his face and giving
place to a look of anxiety.</p>

<p>What if he should not be chosen, after all? What
if he should be thrown down after making every other
Society in order? He felt that the disgrace would
kill him. But that could not be. Merriwell had not
yet appeared in search of a candidate. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
come soon, and something told Defarge that it would
be the hand of Frank Merriwell that would tap him
on the back. Ha! what a satisfaction it would be to
use Merriwell at last as a tool in this manner! Defarge
felt that there was something in making use of
a hated foe in such a way that was even more satisfactory
than in maiming or killing him. Of course,
they would be bound together as brothers in the society,
and Defarge knew he would never again lift a
hand against Merriwell; but the fact that Frank must
leave college in a few short weeks, to return no more,
was a great comfort to Bertrand.</p>

<p>Another cheer went up from the great throng, telling
that yet another candidate had been chosen. The
happy man was seen walking swiftly toward his room,
followed by the grave-faced senior who had slapped
him on the back.</p>

<p>“‘Bones,’” said the watchers.</p>

<p>“Thirteen!” counted Defarge, in a husky whisper.</p>

<p>“Only two more,” muttered Mason.</p>

<p>“Just enough to take us both in,” said Bertrand,
with pretended lightness, though his heart was sinking.</p>

<p>“Not enough to take me in,” declared the youth
from South Carolina rather sadly. “There was never
a ghost of a show for me. I only came here to see the
other fellows made happy. You know my record
when I first came here hurt me, and when a man gets
started wrong at Yale, he has hard work to change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
his course and get on the right track. I’ve been side-tracked
right along.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” nodded Defarge. “Hello! there goes
another ‘Keys’ man. You might make Wolf’s Head,
Mason, you know.”</p>

<p>“My chance of making heaven is better. But surely
a society man like you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Bones,’ or nothing!” muttered Defarge grimly.
“There are two more to go, and I’m waiting.”</p>

<p>“Hooray! Codwell! Hoopee! Hooray!”</p>

<p>“‘Bones!’” said Defarge hoarsely, his face growing
white.</p>

<p>“Fourteen!” counted Mason. “That leaves but one
more.”</p>

<p>“I’m the man!” the French youth inwardly declared.
“I must be the man! What if they did not take me in!
What if I failed after making the other societies!”</p>

<p>It could not be! Such a thing was unprecedented.
Fortune had simply held him back for the fifteenth
man. His mouth and lips were dry and he trembled
a little. Was it possible, after all, that he had failed
to deceive Merriwell? But it had been claimed by all
of Merriwell’s friends that he would not use personal
feelings to retard any man from advancement.</p>

<p>“He will not,” Defarge told himself. “It would be
more like him to go against any feeling of dislike he
may have for me, and seek to uplift me for that very
reason. I’m all right! I am to be the fifteenth man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>He heard nothing of the roar from the crowd as a
“Keys” man was slapped, or the fainter shout as a candidate
went to Wolf’s Head. He was waiting for
Frank Merriwell to appear; he was looking in all directions
for him.</p>

<p>Those in the crowd who were disappointed were
doing their best to hide it away under a mask of happiness
over the good fortune of others. Many were
there who felt a great pain in their hearts and longed
to crawl away and hide themselves, but they laughed in
a strained fashion and talked of the luck of others.
Those who had been to their rooms, followed by tappers,
were back receiving congratulations from friends,
their hands being shaken till their arms were tired.</p>

<p>This was the acme of college glory. Truly, it did
seem that some of those happy-faced chaps were not
nearly as deserving as some others who were congratulating
them. But it is the case all through life. Not
always the men we regard as the most deserving win
the high prizes. We may, however, be wrong in our
estimates of men.</p>

<p>Only one more man to go to “Bones.” Who would
it be? The crowd were speculating.</p>

<p>“Harrison is the man.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe yourself. He can’t get there. It’s
Fairbush.”</p>

<p>“All wrong. It’s Defarge, of course.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; Defarge must be the man. Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
how cool he is. He knows he will be chosen, even
though there is only one more choice. He’ll get it.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Who’s the man he’s talking to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Mason.”</p>

<p>“So it is! What a chump I am not to know him!
He can play ball.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell brought him out. Nobody ever suspected
there was much in him till Merriwell took hold
of him. He never did cut any ice.”</p>

<p>All at once Defarge stiffened up. Moving through
the crowd, looking right and left, he had seen a well-known
senior.</p>

<p>It was Merriwell!</p>

<p>Frank was the last of the “Bones” men to come
forth in search of a candidate. His was the fifteenth
man. All eyes were turned on Merriwell, and a great
hush fell on the watching throng.</p>

<p>In and out, here and there, Frank moved. As he
came near, the heart of many a man rose into his
throat; as he turned away, those swelling, fluttering
hearts seemed to drop back like lead.</p>

<p>The mouth of Defarge was dry as a chip now, and
he felt cold shivers running up and down his spine.
He almost feared to watch Merriwell’s movements.</p>

<p>What if he should be left out? It seemed that he
could never bear the disgrace of it. Mason was speaking
to him. At first he did not seem to hear, but
soon he understood these words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Everywhere for you. He’s passed Fairbush and
Harrison. They are both looking ill. Too bad! I’m
sorry for them. It must be tough on a man who has
counted on being chosen. He sees you, Defarge! He
is coming this way!”</p>

<p>Yes, it seemed that Frank had seen Bertrand at
last. He turned in that direction, and came forward
slowly, as became the dignity of a senior on such a
grave mission.</p>

<p>Bertrand’s heart leaped for joy. Now there could
no longer be a doubt; he was the man, and to Merriwell
had fallen the lot of notifying him.</p>

<p>Defarge came near laughing aloud. He did smile.
He saw how everybody was watching Merriwell.
Many present knew Frank had found in the French
youth a persistent foe, but of late it seemed that Merry
had discovered a way to hold Bertrand in subjection
and submission. But the great mass of students did
not dream of the many villainous attempts Defarge
had made to injure Frank.</p>

<p>In that moment Bertrand Defarge saw visions of
being made a member of Merriwell’s flock. He even
vowed that he would do his level best to gain such
distinction, as it would give him standing after Merriwell
had left college.</p>

<p>Not that he loved Merriwell at all. Not that his
treacherous nature had been changed in the least. But
“Bones” would bring about the eternal burial of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
hatchet, and never could anything cause them to betray
a symptom of enmity.</p>

<p>Frank came nearer.</p>

<p>“It’s a sure thing, Defarge!” said Mason, in a whisper.
“Congratulations.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a sure thing,” thought Bertrand. “I knew
it. How could I ever doubt it for a minute? They
could not skip me. I was a fool to think such a
thing!”</p>

<p>Frank came nearer. Bertrand even turned his body
so that Merry might have less trouble in reaching his
back and giving it a slap. Then he waited again.</p>

<p>Smack! Frank’s hand had fallen.</p>

<p>“Go to your room!”</p>

<p>The fifteenth man had been chosen.</p>

<p>It was not Defarge!</p>


    <div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 class="no-brk"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="fs70">THE MAN WHO WAS NOT CHOSEN.</span></h2>


<p>Defarge heard the smack of Frank’s hand, but he
was astounded beyond measure when he failed to feel
it upon his back. Scarcely could he believe Merriwell
had given the slap. One moment before he had felt
perfectly confident that he was the one who had been
chosen for the honors. Like a flash he turned. What
he saw astonished him beyond measure.</p>

<p>Hock Mason, the youth from South Carolina, was
looking at Frank Merriwell in a most bewildered way,
as if he doubted the evidence of his own senses.</p>

<p>Merriwell had slapped Mason.</p>

<p>In all that gathering of students, no man had less
expected such an honor. To Mason it seemed that the
heavens had opened with a golden shower.</p>

<p>To Defarge it was like a bolt of lightning from a
clear sky.</p>

<p>Plainly Mason could not yet believe he had been selected
for “Bones.” He was on the verge of telling
Frank that he must have made a mistake.</p>

<p>Defarge, also, felt like crying out to Merry: “You’re
wrong, you chump! Here I am!”</p>

<p>Plainly, the selection of the fifteenth man had been
a surprise to many, for there was a protracted hush.
Then it broke, and there was a great cheer for Mason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The blood rushed back to the face of the Southerner.
It came so fast that he grew dizzy and everything
seemed to swim round him. He put out his hands, as
if to grasp something. Was he dreaming? Had this
greatest honor that a Yale man can receive really come
to him?</p>

<p>There was no mistake. The crowd had greeted the
selection with a cheer, and he had heard his name at
the end of it. He, who had expected nothing, had
received the great reward.</p>

<p>With faltering steps, he started to go to his room,
but he was so bewildered that he started in the wrong
direction. Somebody put an arm round him and turned
him the right way, whispering in his ear:</p>

<p>“I’m gug-gosh darn gug-glad for ye!”</p>

<p>It was Joe Gamp&mdash;poor, dear old Joe, who had
never “cut any ice” in society life at Yale. Joe Gamp,
the lad from New Hampshire, who would have given
up any hope of inheriting his father’s farm for the
glory of entering “Bones,” had seen in the face of the
Southerner the unspeakable joy of the moment, and he
whispered that he was glad.</p>

<p>Mason remembered it afterward, for he was not a
fellow to forget. Mason, who had come to Yale with
a feeling of prejudice for “Yanks,” would have fought
to the death for one “Yank” after that. For more
than one, as Merriwell was a Northerner, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
long felt that he would do anything in his power for
Frank.</p>

<p>The burden of disappointment had fallen heavily on
many men that day, but to none had come greater joy
than to Hock Mason. His heart was threatening to
tear a hole in his bosom as he walked through that
crowd, which parted for him to pass, knowing that
Frank Merriwell was gravely following in his footsteps.</p>

<p>Frank’s face was unreadable as that of a stone image
as he brushed past Defarge and followed Mason.
And so they proceeded across the campus and disappeared
into one of the arches.</p>

<p>Behind them they left a youth who felt that he must
die of disappointment and shame. Defarge knew that
it had been supposed he was sure to make “Bones” or
“Keys,” and he had told himself that nothing less than
the greater society would satisfy him. Now, however,
he was weak and crumbling with the bitterness of it all
upon him.</p>

<p>It must be that he had been chosen by “Keys.” That
was the last hope, and the last “Keys” man was passing
through the throng in search of the final candidate.</p>

<p>“He must be after me!” Defarge inwardly cried.</p>

<p>But the searcher had found his man. His hand
rose and fell.</p>

<p>“It’s Carson! Hooray! Carson! Carson!”</p>

<p>Berlin Carson was the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Defarge started to go somewhere. He did not know
where he wanted to go, but he had a desire to get
away. This was the day he had lived for during the
past year; and this was what it had brought him!</p>

<p>“Merriwell is to blame for it all!” he cried mentally.
“Oh, curse him! But for him this shame would
not have fallen on me!”</p>

<p>He was wrong. He alone was to blame. His own
treacherous nature, which he had so skilfully concealed
at first, had led him on to his downfall. He had been
very shrewd in his early days at Yale. It was only
when he became ambitious to overthrow Frank Merriwell
that his downfall began. With each failure he
had dropped lower, but he did not realize how fast he
was falling. Merriwell had shielded him by silence,
but nothing could keep his rascality secret. He had
plotted, and his plots, all of them failures, had reacted
upon himself.</p>

<p>As he was moving away, he bethought himself of
one last possibility, and paused. Perhaps he had been
chosen for Wolf’s Head.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago he would have scorned the
thought; he would have asserted with disdain that
nothing could induce him to enter that order. Now
he stopped and looked round, in hope that the lowest
of the three societies might prove a shelter for him in
this hour of distress. How gladly he would accept it
now!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>But even as he paused with this faint hope, the final
man was chosen for Wolf’s Head, and he knew at last
that he had no chance.</p>

<p>This, in truth, was the worst punishment Defarge
had ever received for his wrong-doing. Physical punishment
had been as nothing in comparison to it. He
did not mind a few bruises; he did not care if he happened
to be confined to his room for a day or two.
But this struck straight to his heart.</p>

<p>In this moment came the thought that he had
brought it all on himself when he sought to harm Merriwell.
He felt that somehow Merriwell was responsible,
and the hatred he had known for Frank in the past
became a thousand times more intense.</p>

<p>“I could kill him!” he muttered hoarsely.</p>

<p>He saw the chosen candidates receiving congratulations
on all sides, and the spectacle maddened him. He
was muttering to himself as he found his way out onto
the Green, where he wandered round and round for
half an hour before realizing that he was acting like a
daffy person.</p>

<p>There was a little place where Bertrand had often
dropped in to have a quiet drink, and toward it he now
turned his steps, for he felt that nothing but drink
could give him relief.</p>

<p>He found his favorite seat by the corner screen,
dropping down heavily and sitting there staring blankly
at the table when the waiter came up. Not until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
waiter had asked him twice for his order did he arouse
himself. Then he ordered absinth.</p>

<p>After a little it was placed before him, the devil’s
drink that lifts men to the seventh heaven of bliss,
only to hurl them at last to the lowest depths of hell.
He knew when he took the stuff that it robs men of
manhood and makes them its slaves, yet he drank it.
He knew the awful effect of that decoction on the human
being, for absinth-drinkers soon find their way
to madhouses, yet he drank it. He knew he was taking
into his system a poison that must work on every
part of him, yet he drank it.</p>

<p>It soothed him after a little, and that was what he
sought. He leaned back in his chair and lighted a
cigarette, which he puffed leisurely. In the blue smoke
he saw strange pictures of himself overthrowing and
destroying one whom he hated with all his heart, and
that one was Merriwell. How strong he felt! Why, it
seemed that he could crush Merriwell to the earth
without an effort. What did he care, after all, if he
had failed to be chosen to enter the ivy-wreathed door
of “Bones”! That was a passing joy, but absinth he
could have always&mdash;till death! “Waiter, bring another
of the same.”</p>

<p>With the second glass, everything passed from him
save his determination to get even with Merriwell.
Of late he had feared Merriwell, but now he did not
fear him. Merriwell had seemed to possess a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
power over him, but now he felt that the power was
broken. He knew he was in every way superior to
Merriwell, and it seemed strange that all others did not
know it as well. In his heart something was making
soft music, like chiming bells, and he listened to it
with quiet delight. How easy it was to start that
music to going! “Waiter, another absinth.”</p>

<p>But the waiter was not near, and it was too much
effort to call him. He smiled to think he had cared
if he failed to get into “Bones.” Foolish! He knew
the fellows who had been chosen, and he was better
than the best of them. He would prove it, too, some
day. He knew he could prove it easily, for he had
the power to do anything he desired.</p>

<p>Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle!&mdash;he seemed to hear the fall
of water in a fountain, which sparkled and glowed before
his eyes, as his imagination conjured it there. He
saw it in the moonlight of a soft Italian night, and
the odor of a thousand flowers was brought to him
with a passing breeze. He looked into the fountain,
and a face smiled up at him. He saw it was the face
of the man he hated, and he put out his strong hands
to grasp it by the throat. There was no struggle. He
was so strong that his enemy could not struggle. So
he forced him down and held him beneath the surface
of the water, watching him drown. It was a great
delight to watch him drown.</p>

<p>The end came, and he relinquished his hold on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
throat. Down, down to the bottom of the fountain
sank the head, and there it lay looking up at him with
wide-open, staring eyes. He nodded and smiled at it,
saying: “I have conquered at last!” But it simply
stared straight into his soul.</p>

<p>Those eyes made him shiver a little, they were so
cold and glassy. Those eyes had cast upon him a fearful
spell when their owner lived, but they were powerless
now. Were they powerless? Dead though he
knew they were, they seemed to take hold of him and
possess him. He could not tear his gaze from them.</p>

<p>Slowly round the fountain he moved, trying to
escape from those eyes. He did not see the head
move, but it must have moved, for always those eyes
were fixed upon him.</p>

<p>A great horror crept over him. What did it mean?
Was he not the victor? He was seized by a fear that
even in death Frank Merriwell remained his master.</p>

<p>Then he longed to shriek aloud, to run away, to do
something. He could feel those dead eyes getting a
stronger hold upon him. He knew he was becoming
their victim. He had not conquered; Merriwell was
still his master.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said aloud, “I am coming; I am coming.”</p>

<p>Then, with a singular look on his drawn face, he
rose, hat in hand, and started from the place. He
walked like one in a trance, staring straight ahead,
minding nothing around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am coming,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“That’s the last drink of that stuff he gets in this
place!” muttered the waiter, shaking his head and staring
after Defarge. “He’s been up against it hard.
Never saw a fellow take to that dope so suddenly as he
has, and he’s gone down like a rock in less than a
week. Next time I’ll refuse to serve him.”</p>

<span class="fs70">HOW SKELDING QUIT.</span></h2>


<p>“It’th a thame!” declared Lew Veazie, standing before
Chickering’s fireplace, his feet as far apart as his
short legs would comfortably permit, while he inhaled
the smoke of a cigarette with the air of one long accustomed
to the things.</p>

<p>“That’s so, chummie,” agreed Ollie Lord, regarding
Lew with a look of admiration. “It’s a howling
shame!”</p>

<p>“They say his mind is affected,” said Rupert, who
had gently seated himself in a position that would
bring the least possible strain on the knees of his
handsomely creased trousers.</p>

<p>“Oh, no doubt of it!” nodded Julian Ives from the
opposite side of the table, pressing a hand against his
beautiful bang, as if he feared the air might disturb its
symmetry, or it might fall off.</p>

<p>“It must have been an awful disappointment to
him,” solemnly croaked Tilton Hull.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” sighed Chickering. “The whole college
is talking about it. He was a ‘Deke’ man, and
yet he failed even to get into Wolf’s Head.”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly dreadful, fellows!” said Ollie Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thimply awful!” said Lew. “And evwybody
knowth who ith to blame faw it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, chummie,” agreed Ollie.</p>

<p>“The man whose word is law at Yale brought it
about, of course,” croaked Hull, like a parson droning
a sermon with uplifted eyes.</p>

<p>“Let’s not be too harsh on any one,” put in Rupert
hastily, with a warning gesture of his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, come off!” exclaimed Ives. “The man had
little feeling for poor Defarge, and, without doubt, it
was his influence that kept Defarge down.”</p>

<p>Gene Skelding was sitting square in a chair, his
hands clasped, his eyes roving from one speaker to
another, a strange, grim expression on his face. Thus
far he had taken little part in the conversation, but
now he broke in.</p>

<p>“I think Defarge has only himself to blame,” he
said.</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed the others, staring at him in
startled surprise.</p>

<p>“Let’s be honest with ourselves for once,” said
Gene. “I was the one who found Defarge, hatless,
coatless, his shirt torn open at the neck, wandering
about in the old cemetery on the evening of tap day.
I took him to his room and watched him all night
long.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve told us how he raved about Merriwell’s
dead eyes,” came hoarsely from Hull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“The fellow had been drinking dope of some sort,”
asserted Gene. “I’ve told you that.”</p>

<p>“Dwiven to dwink by the injuthice he had endured,”
put in Lew, with an effort to be dramatic.</p>

<p>“Just so, chummie,” nodded Ollie.</p>

<p>“He had taken to drink, all right, all right,” nodded
Gene. “But he acted exactly as if he had been hypnotized
by those dead eyes he raved about.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose made him talk about Merriwell
having dead eyes?” asked Chickering.</p>

<p>“I was with him long enough to know that he
seemed to see some sort of vision. He talked about a
fountain in the blackness of a dark night, and a face
down in the fountain&mdash;a face that seemed luminous,
so he could see it for all of the darkness. It seemed
to me that he thought he had drowned Merriwell in
that fountain, but he fancied it was far off in Italy, or
some foreign country.”</p>

<p>“And all those wild fancies were brought about by
his terrible disappointment,” said Julian Ives.</p>

<p>“They were brought about by the stuff he had been
drinking,” asserted Skelding. “I took some pains to
investigate a little, and I have found that he’s been
drinking absinth. That explains it. He’s in a bad
way.”</p>

<p>“Driven there by a certain man,” said Chickering
solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Driven there by his own blank foolishness,” said
Gene positively. “No man can be in the condition Defarge
was in and drink absinth without quickly paying
the penalty.”</p>

<p>“Tempwance lecture by Mithter Thkelding!” cried
Veazie, and Ollie snickered.</p>

<p>Gene gave the two little fellows a look that seemed
full of positive disgust and contempt, but he held his
temper, going on:</p>

<p>“Defarge, like some of the rest of us, has been
bucking up against the wrong man, and he did not
know enough to throw up the sponge when he was
beaten. That is the whole of it in a nutshell.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, Gene,” said Julian Ives,
staring at Skelding. “Do you mean that we have
bucked against the wrong man when we bucked against
Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean. Doesn’t it look that way?
Now, be honest in answering.”</p>

<p>There was consternation in that room at once. Always
Skelding had been the fiercest and bitterest
against Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” croaked Hull, standing on his tiptoes
in order to glare down over his collar at Gene.
“What’s this I hear? One of our number talking like
a Merriwell saphead? I must be dreaming! I know
I am!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Gene is joking!” said Ives.</p>

<p>“Gwathuth! What a queer joke!” murmured Lew.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you fellows what I did with Defarge
before I left him the next morning,” said Gene,
who had risen to his feet. “All night I listened to his
ravings. Now, you all know I’m not squeamish, but
I confess that some of the things I heard gave me cold
chills. He had some of the most horrible fancies, and
through them all he was hunted by Merriwell’s eyes.
Those eyes seemed to follow him everywhere. He
fought them, he threw the furniture at them, he covered
his own eyes to shut out the sight of them, but he
could not get away from them.</p>

<p>“I pitied the poor fellow. His face was ghastly and
drawn, and great beads of perspiration started out on
it at times. His lips would be drawn back from his
teeth, and he looked like a grinning death-head. Of
course, I knew that the most of the things he raved
about were fancies, but with those he mixed lots of
facts. I found that more than once he had thought of
murdering Merriwell. He had even tried it. Now,
I’m no saint, and I have fancied that I could kill Merriwell;
but never have I been ready to carry it to that
extent when the time came to lift my hand. In listening
to the mutterings of Defarge I found that Merriwell
had caught and baffled him. Still, for some reason,
Merriwell had not crushed him. He had seen at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
last that he must make his peace with Merriwell if he
was to get into ‘Bones,’ and so he went and played
a part.</p>

<p>“He tried to fool Merriwell into thinking him repentant,
and he thought he had succeeded; but I do not
think it so easy to fool that man, even though he may
let one fancy he is being fooled. Merriwell saw
through Defarge all the time. In fact, I think Merriwell
must have hypnotic power over Defarge, and so
he could read Bertrand’s secret. That is why those
eyes seemed to hunt Defarge so. The eyes were before
his fancy, just as he had seen them boring into his
soul more than once. Now, it’s likely that somehow
there was an understanding that Defarge was to go
to ‘Bones.’ Whether Merriwell found a way to stop
him or not I cannot say, but it was just punishment for
the injuries Defarge has tried to do Merriwell, and
so I told the fellow before I left him that morning.</p>

<p>“He was pretty sober when I talked to him, and I
told him we were both thundering scoundrels and pitiful
fools. Had we been decent fellows we might have
belonged to Merriwell’s crowd, and that would have
helped carry us anywhere. But our greed and our
hatred had made us outcasts. We were getting our
dues. He had to listen to me, for I held him while
I talked. That night with him was just what I needed
to open my eyes at last, and now I’m aware that I
have made a howling idiot of myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>They stared at him in wonder. Was this Skelding?
He had been the worst of the lot.</p>

<p>“I believe staying with Defarge that night affected
his head some, fellows,” whispered Chickering.</p>

<p>Gene gave Rupert a look of contempt.</p>

<p>“It did affect my head,” he acknowledged. “It gave
me, I believe, a little more sense than I have had for
a long, long time. I came to see myself and a few
of my particular friends, as well as the men I have
reckoned as my enemies, in the true light. Chickering,
I’ve never held you in much respect, for you are a
hypocrite, and I have known it right along.”</p>

<p>“Would you insult your friend in his own rooms?”
cried Ives, also starting up.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Rupert, with a gentle gesture of restraint
and sorrow. “Do not revile him, Julian. Even
though he may unjustly turn upon me, I have no revengeful
feeling in my heart, and I cannot forget that
he has often taken tea from my hand.”</p>

<p>“Go on!” exclaimed Gene. “I’ve borrowed money
of you, too. I know it. If it hadn’t been for that I’d
not be here now. You knew how to make me one of
your set. You lent me money, but I’ve paid it back,
every dirty cent! Haven’t I? Answer me! Haven’t
I?”</p>

<p>Rupert shuddered a little at this fierceness.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I believe you have,” he said.</p>

<p>“You believe! You know! Say you know it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, very well; I know it,” agreed the alarmed fellow.</p>

<p>“That has been one of your holds on all your
friends. Your friends! Well, here they are! Look
at them! Compare them with Frank Merriwell’s
friends! Ha, ha, ha! That night I spent with Defarge
I came to look the whole matter over, and I saw
just how it was that I belonged to our gang. Do you
know what we are? Well, we’re outcasts, every one
of us. We are compelled to flock by ourselves for company,
as other men want nothing to do with us. Merriwell
to-day, the man we hate with all our hearts, is
better known and more popular than any other man
who ever entered Yale. He is the idol of the youth
of our country. They regard him as the typical young
American. But what are we? We are looked on as
snobs, and cads, and sappies. It’s just what is coming
to us, and we can’t kick!”</p>

<p>“He must have turned crazy with Defarge!” exclaimed
Ives.</p>

<p>“He must!” croaked Hull.</p>

<p>“I turned crazy enough to get some sense into my
head. It’s too late for me to ever make anything of
myself here in college, but I have resolved to turn
over a new leaf, just the same. Even Defarge was
given a show on the eleven last fall. Though he had
been Merriwell’s open foe, Merriwell did not keep him
off the eleven. That man is square as a brick, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that’s the way he gets his friends and holds them. He
does hold them, too. You know it, every one of you.
Did you ever know one of his friends to go back on
him? Never. It’s a wonder how he grapples them
to him with hooks of steel.”</p>

<p>“The trouble with him,” said Ives, in an aside to
Chickering, “is that he found more than he could
handle in Hodge that night. You know when I
mean.”</p>

<p>Rupert nodded. Skelding flushed.</p>

<p>“I fought Hodge squarely,” he said, “and he
whipped me, just as he can any man here&mdash;or any
two of you!”</p>

<p>“He’s done for!” said Chickering, with a gesture of
sorrowful regret. “He’ll be bowing down and licking
the dust off Merriwell’s feet now.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie!” said Gene. “Merriwell won’t have
me, even if I want to. But I am done with this crowd.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have many friends,” croaked Hull, with
an expression of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“That’s tho!” cried Veazie.</p>

<p>“Just so, chummie!” agreed Lord.</p>

<p>“I know you are right about that. I’ll have to go
it alone, unless I can convert Defarge, and I’m afraid
he’s too far gone, poor devil! I think his selfishness
and his hatred for Merriwell have brought about his
ruin.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell has ruined him!” cried Ives savagely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
“You would have said so a week ago! I don’t know
what you’re going to try to do, but I don’t believe
you’ll get taken into Merriwell’s flock.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to be; but I’ll take myself out of this
flock, and that will give me a chance to regard myself
as something more of a man. What are you, one and
all? Chickering is a pitiful creature, with just enough
brains to be a hypocrite. Hull never had a real
thought in his wooden head in all his life. You, Ives,
are a poor imitation of a real man, and, though you
sometimes bluster and brag, you are always the first
to dodge behind shelter when there is danger. Veazie
is a poor, simple little thing, who never can become a
man, and Lord is his counterpart.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, thir!” screamed Veazie, shaking his fist
at Gene. “I won’t thand it, thir!”</p>

<p>“Poor Gene!” said Rupert, with increasing sadness.
“After all I have done for him!”</p>

<p>“He’s an insulting scamp!” croaked Huff, his face
very red.</p>

<p>“He’s a&mdash;&mdash;” began Ives, but Skelding cut him
short, advising:</p>

<p>“Don’t you say much, unless you want to fight. I’d
be ashamed to put my hands on any of the others, but
I may be tempted to thrash you before leaving, so
you’d better keep your mouth closed.”</p>

<p>Ives gasped and gurgled, but Skelding really seemed
to find it difficult to keep off, so Julian closed up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Skelding took up his hat and light overcoat, tossing
the latter over his arm.</p>

<p>“I’m going,” he said, “and I’ll never come back to
this place any more, I’m happy to say. I feel as if
there may be a chance for me to become a man. And I
want to warn you to let Defarge alone. He’s pretty
low now, and you’ll only send him lower.”</p>

<p>Skelding walked to the door, where he paused,
turned, and surveyed them all with a look of contempt.</p>

<p>“When you meet me hereafter,” he said, “kindly refrain
from speaking to me. It will be best for you to
do so, for I promise you that I shall take it as a deadly
insult if you speak. I may not be able to whip Bart
Hodge, but I’ll bet my shirt that I can whip any one
of you, or the whole bunch together. Good night.”</p>

<p>Then he went out.</p>

<p>“Go to the devil!” hissed Julian Ives.</p>

<p>“Poor, misguided fellow!” sighed Chickering. “I
must have some tea to steady my nerves.”</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">THE MAD STUDENT.</span></h2>


<p>It was with a feeling of unadulterated satisfaction
that Gene Skelding left the perfumed rooms of Rupert
Chickering, after having expressed his opinion of the
Chickering set, separately and collectively.</p>

<p>It had always seemed a little strange to any one who
knew Gene that he had been one of the members of that
crew of worthless cigarette-smokers. For Skelding
was a fighter, and he was the only genuine fighter in
the collection. The others were cowards of the most
abject sort.</p>

<p>Skelding had a way of closing his mouth firmly, and
keeping it closed, which was a most difficult thing for
any other member of the set to do.</p>

<p>Indeed, Tilton Hull found it possible to keep his
mouth closed only when it was held thus by his collar
propping his lower jaw up. Take away his collar, and
his jaw drooped at once.</p>

<p>Lew Veazie always carried his mouth open, breathing
through it from habit. It would have caused him
great discomfort, not to say agony, had he been compelled
to close his mouth and keep it thus for three
minutes without a break.</p>

<p>Of course, Ollie Lord imitated Veazie in everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and he fancied that the insipid, brainless expression of
a cigarette-smoker with open mouth in repose was
proper.</p>

<p>Julian Ives breathed through his mouth from habit,
but Chickering had a way of pressing his lips together,
turning up his eyes, clasping his pale hands,
and looking like a saint. This was the expression he
wore as Skelding retired from the room, and he hoped
it would be so impressed on Gene’s mind that the “rude
fellow” would come to believe in time that he had
done Rupert a great wrong. Skelding afterward spoke
of that look as reminding him of a dying calf.</p>

<p>Gene descended the stairs, stepped on the steps, and
drew several deep breaths, as if he would clear his
lungs of the atmosphere that had defiled them while he
was in that room. He was satisfied with himself and
what he had done.</p>

<p>For some time he had been growing more and more
disgusted with the Chickering crowd. Of late he had
appeared in public with them as seldom as possible.
Skelding was not a fool, and he saw at last that his
folly in taking up with such fellows had given him
his standing at Yale, and that standing was not pleasant
to contemplate.</p>

<p>At last he had been taught the old, old lesson that
a man is judged by the company he keeps. Most boys
are told this early in life, but somehow it seems to have
little impression on them until their eyes are opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
by experience. Shun bad company; better have no
friends than to be friendly with the wrong sort of fellows.</p>

<p>Skelding had never smoked cigarettes until he fell in
with the Chickering crowd. Then it was nothing more
than natural that he should take to them, for they were
forever near him, being smoked by his companions
and offered to him.</p>

<p>He had not found them agreeable at first, but surely
he, big and strong, could endure as much as that little
whipper-snapper Veazie, and so he had persisted in
using them until the habit was set upon him.</p>

<p>A dozen times he had vowed that he would smoke
no more, but always he had found the things at hand
in Chickering’s room, and the cloud of smoke hanging
there almost constantly led him to break his pledge.
The man who does not smoke is annoyed to extremes
by the smoke of others; but he soon ceases to notice it
if he fires up and joins them.</p>

<p>Now, however, Skelding paused on the step and
shook his light overcoat with the idea of getting the
smoke smell out of it. Never before had the fresh air
seemed so good to him. He drew it into his lungs
with satisfaction and relief. Then he reached into a
pocket of that overcoat and took out part of a package
of cigarettes.</p>

<p>“There!” he exclaimed; “by the eternal hills, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
done with you forever! You are the badge of degeneracy.”</p>

<p>He threw the package away. It seemed to him that
at that moment he had severed the last strand that had
bound him to the Chickering set.</p>

<p>There was untold satisfaction in the feeling of relief
and freedom which came to him. He looked back
on what he had been, and wondered at his folly. He
contemplated his association with Rupert Chickering
and his pals, wondering that he could have found any
satisfaction in such company. No matter what happened,
he was done with them.</p>

<p>It is hard to understand how great a thing this
was for him to do. Skelding was a man who liked
companionship. He was not given to the habit of solitude,
and he desired friends. But he knew that, without
doubt, he was cutting himself off from the only
men who would be friendly toward him while he
remained in college.</p>

<p>He had been stamped with the odious brand of
Chickering, and other men would not care to associate
with him. Nevertheless, he felt better.</p>

<p>“I’ll go it alone,” he said grimly. “It’s the best
thing I can do now.”</p>

<p>Then he thought of Defarge, and he felt a sudden
sympathy for him. They were both outcasts. Perhaps
they might strike up a friendship. A few seconds
later he was on the way to the room of Bertrand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Skelding did not pause to knock. Turning the knob
quietly, he entered the room. Defarge, thin, haggard,
wild-looking, was standing by a table, loading a revolver.
He muttered to himself:</p>

<p>“It’s my only way to escape! I feel that he has released
me from the spell, so that I am my own master
now; but he may put it in me the next time we
meet, and I shall be the slave of his devilish eyes!
He must die!”</p>

<p>“Defarge!”</p>

<p>Skelding spoke, and, with a little cry, Bertrand
whirled round, pointing the revolver at the newcomer.
The hand that held the weapon shook violently.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” said Gene, stepping forward,
“you could not hit a house that was ten feet away.
Your nerves are in terrible shape, my boy.”</p>

<p>Defarge lowered the revolver.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I thought it was he!” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Did you think he had come?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why should he do that?”</p>

<p>“He has done it before now. He came here once
and looked at me with those eyes of his. I don’t remember
much after that, but I know I talked and told
him things I did not mean to tell. I thought he had
come again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did you mean to do in case he had?”</p>

<p>“Shoot him!”</p>

<p>“You could not have hit him at a distance of ten
feet. You were shaking like a leaf.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;I know! You see what I’ve come to. He
is to blame for it all.” The eyes of Defarge were
glaring and bloodshot.</p>

<p>“You may be somewhat to blame yourself. Do you
remember what I told you the other morning, after
fighting with you here all night to keep you still and
prevent you from doing something that would ruin
you forever?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t remember much about it. I know you
were here, but that’s all. I was rather nutty that
night, wasn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” said Skelding dryly. “You thought you
had choked and drowned Merriwell in Italy or somewhere.
You were haunted by his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Curse those eyes! They haunt me all the time!
Skelding, you don’t suppose the fellow has the power
of second sight?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, it seems to me as if he is watching me all
the while, and that is why I can’t get away from those
eyes. I have tried to get away from them in the dark,
but in the dark I see them and they seem to see me all
the plainer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Absinth is what ails you, Defarge. You’ve got
to quit it&mdash;or go up the spout.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t believe I can quit it,” confessed Bertrand,
with a pitiful expression of helplessness. “It’s
the only thing that soothes my nerves.”</p>

<p>“It may seem to quiet them for the time, but it
tears you all to pieces afterward, and you know it. And
every time you take the stuff you are becoming more
and more its victim. It has a fearful hold on you already.”</p>

<p>Defarge trembled.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could do one thing I would be all right!”
he cried.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Get away from those eyes! I’ll do it, too! I’m
going to get away from them! I know a way!”</p>

<p>Skelding thought of the revolver, which Bertrand
had been loading. It was lying on the table now, beside
two boxes of cartridges.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” he asked. “You’re not thinking
of shooting yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of shooting him!”</p>

<p>“Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“That’s it! that’s it! It’s the only way, I tell you!
Don’t talk to me! I’ve figured it all out. When his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
eyes are closed they will trouble me no more. I’m
going to close them forever!”</p>

<p>“He’s been drinking again to-night!” thought Gene.
“He is full of the stuff, and it’s impossible to reason
with him now. How can I handle him? I must find a
way to do so without letting him know it.</p>

<p>“That is a desperate remedy, don’t you think?” he
said aloud.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but it’s a desperate case. I can’t sleep
nights, Skelding. The minute I put out my light and
lie down I see those eyes watching me. Even though
I close my own eyes tightly I see them just the same.
Skelding, the only thing that can save me from the
madhouse is the death of Merriwell! I’ve thought it
all out, and I have arrived at that conviction.”</p>

<p>“And you bought a revolver for that purpose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I bought that to use at the political celebration
last fall. Bought a box of blanks to go with
it, but I did not fire them all. There are some of them
in that box there. I bought the other box to-day.”</p>

<p>“The others are not blanks.”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Told the man I bought them of that
I wanted to use them to shoot a dog. That was right,
too! I am going to shoot a dog with them!”</p>

<p>“You have loaded the revolver with the new cartridges?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. It’s all ready now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, let’s talk this over a little. Sit down, Defarge.”</p>

<p>Skelding had taken a seat by the table.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Bertrand. He took a bottle from a
little closet and looked at it. It was empty. “I must
have a drink,” he declared, his hand shaking. “Wait
a minute till I come back. I know a fellow who has
something in his room.”</p>

<p>He slipped out of his room, leaving Skelding there.
In less than five minutes he was back, his face flushed
and a changed expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I found something,” he said. “Now I’m all right
for a while! Now I have nerve! It’s when I feel this
way that I’m ready for anything! It’s when I feel this
way that I shall do the job! I’ll put out those eyes
so they’ll never bother me any more! Look at my
hand. See how steady it is.”</p>

<p>He held it out, and Gene saw that it did not shake.</p>

<p>“Good,” nodded Skelding. “Now you should be
able to sit down and talk without getting daffy.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use? I know what you want to say to
me. You fool! Why, Skelding, I thought you were
one of Merriwell’s bitterest enemies!”</p>

<p>“I was&mdash;once.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve lost your nerve, just like all the others.”</p>

<p>“It’s not that. I have had my eyes opened.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Don’t tell me! You do not love him any
more than you did before, but you have lost your nerve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
I am the only man left with any nerve, and I get that
from the right kind of stuff. They think Merriwell is
the only thing that ever happened here! He has put
them all under a spell&mdash;all, all! I believe he has put
you under a spell! You’d never have changed like
this if he hadn’t&mdash;never! But his time is limited! I
swear it! Why did I load that revolver? Ha, ha!
Why, for a dog, of course. When is the best time to
shoot dogs? Tell me that, Skelding. Tell me!”</p>

<p>Gene saw that Defarge was in a condition of excitement
bordering on frenzy, and he wondered how he
was going to control the fellow. It would not do to
leave him then, for he might do any desperate deed.</p>

<p>“The night is the best time to shoot dogs!” declared
Bertrand. “It’s night now. Now is the time,
and I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>He caught the revolver from the table.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” gasped Gene, starting
up.</p>

<p>“I am going to shoot that dog!” cried Defarge, as
he bolted like a madman from the room.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted Skelding, leaping after him.</p>

<p>Down the stairs went Defarge, taking four and five
at a time. Skelding sprang after him with reckless
haste, determined to overtake and stop him somehow.
It was a wild chase. The deranged fellow reached
the foot of the last flight and bounded out of doors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Gene was not far behind. Away they went toward
Vanderbilt Hall.</p>

<p>“He’s going to try to shoot Merriwell now!” panted
Skelding. “That last drink turned him into a madman.”</p>

<p>It happened that they met no one. Up to Merriwell’s
room rushed Defarge, with Skelding gaining
on him. But Gene was not able to overtake the maniac.</p>

<p>As Gene came up he saw the door to Merriwell’s
room standing open. A light was shining from
within. Defarge had just leaped into the room, and
Merriwell, who had been writing, had risen quickly
from his desk.</p>

<p>Then Skelding saw Defarge thrust the muzzle of
the revolver right against Frank Merriwell’s breast
and fire. There was a flash, a puff of smoke, and the
muffled report of the weapon.</p>

<p>Merriwell had made absolutely no move to save
himself, and the madman had fired pointblank at
Frank’s heart, the muzzle of the weapon being not
more than six inches from the breast of the intended
victim.</p>

<span class="fs70">FRANK OFFERS HIS HAND.</span></h2>


<p>It seemed that the crazy student had shot Frank
Merriwell straight through the heart. But Merry did
not fall. Instead, he grappled with Defarge, seized
the revolver in his hand, and flung him back against
the wall.</p>

<p>Then Skelding rushed in, and Frank must have
thought Gene there to attack him also. However,
Skelding also grappled with Defarge, holding him
helpless while Merry wrested away the revolver.</p>

<p>The murderous student fought like a fiend. No
cries came from his lips, but the insane light glared
from his eyes, and he frothed at the mouth.</p>

<p>“Hold him steady,” he said to Skelding. “Just give
me a moment with him.”</p>

<p>For in that furious struggle Defarge seemed to have
superhuman strength, and he caused them both to
exert themselves to their utmost to subdue him.</p>

<p>“Look at me, Defarge!” commanded Frank. “Look
me straight in the eyes!”</p>

<p>“No!” muttered the furious fellow. “I will not!”</p>

<p>He tried to keep his eyes turned away.</p>

<p>“Look at me!” commanded Merriwell again.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look at me!”</p>

<p>He could not resist. Slowly he turned his eyes on
those of Frank.</p>

<p>Skelding looked on in breathless, wondering silence.
He saw that a great struggle was taking place between
these two, and he knew well enough who would
be the victor.</p>

<p>The fierceness died out of the face and eyes of the
French youth. His power of resistance faded and diminished.
His contorted features relaxed, and a
sleepy expression came over his eyes that had been so
wild and fierce. Then he stood there quietly, making
no move.</p>

<p>“Let him go, Skelding,” said Merriwell, in a calm
tone.</p>

<p>Gene stepped back, but held himself ready in case
Bertrand broke out again. Merry had taken his
hands from the fellow. Now he pointed to a chair,
saying:</p>

<p>“Sit down there!”</p>

<p>Seeming unable to offer any resistance, the fellow
obeyed as meekly as a mastered dog. Then Frank
seemed to turn some attention to himself. His face
showed wonderment, as if he were not a little bewildered.</p>

<p>“The fellow fired at me with the muzzle of that revolver
less than a foot from my heart,” he said, “yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
felt no touch of the bullet. I do not quite understand
it.”</p>

<p>He looked at Skelding inquiringly. It was plain
that Frank suspected Gene, and he was on the alert.
He must have wondered that Skelding followed Defarge
closely in the rush into that room, and not even
Gene’s readiness in aiding Merriwell to master the
crazy student explained his action.</p>

<p>It is probable that Frank half-suspected a plot between
Defarge and Skelding that had somehow miscarried.
In case Defarge failed in his attempt, Skelding
was to be on hand for some purpose. Still this
did not explain why Gene had been so willing to grapple
with Defarge and hold him while Merry subdued
the fellow with the power of his eyes.</p>

<p>Skelding looked at the revolver and then at Merriwell,
who was watching him closely.</p>

<p>“It is loaded with blank cartridges,” Gene said.</p>

<p>Frank picked it up and examined it. He saw that
Skelding told the truth.</p>

<p>Some students who had been startled by the shot
now came to Frank’s door in search of the place from
whence the sound had issued. Merriwell blocked the
door so that they could not see into the room, laughing
as he said:</p>

<p>“Accidents will happen, you know; but it’s nothing
serious. The revolver was loaded with a blank, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
so no one would have been hurt, even if it had been
pointed at somebody.”</p>

<p>In this manner, without telling them a falsehood,
he gave them the impression that the weapon had been
discharged while it was being carelessly handled, and
they departed satisfied, although some of them wondered
not a little that Frank Merriwell should handle
a revolver in a careless manner.</p>

<p>Frank closed the door and turned back, the revolver
in his hand. Defarge was sitting quietly on the chair,
while Skelding was standing near.</p>

<p>“You did that very nicely, Merriwell; but I don’t see
why you sheltered us.”</p>

<p>“Sheltered you?” cried Frank. “Why, what did
you have to do with it? You helped me hold him.”</p>

<p>“Because I knew he was mad. I am his friend.”</p>

<p>“I have never fancied you were my friend, Skelding.”</p>

<p>“Yet you did not tell the truth to those fellows.
Even though Defarge tried to kill you, you did not tell
the truth.”</p>

<p>“Defarge did not know what he was doing. I feel
sure of that, for I saw madness in his face and eyes.”</p>

<p>Skelding nodded.</p>

<p>“You are right. He was mad, driven so by disappointment
and by the devil’s drink he has been taking
of late. It was a fearful blow to him, Merriwell, when
he failed to make ‘Bones.’ I do not believe you unjustly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
used your influence against him; perhaps you
were justified in your heart in using your influence
thus. But he felt that you were the cause of his failure.
He brooded over it. He has been drinking
absinth, and it has made him a maniac.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for him,” declared Frank sincerely.
“He has always been ready to do me any and every
possible injury, and yet I am sorry to see any man
in such shape. Even though he might have wished to
kill me, he would not have tried to do it this way had
he been in his right mind. He would have known
it meant hanging for him, and that would have restrained
him.”</p>

<p>Skelding nodded.</p>

<p>“That is true.”</p>

<p>“But he may not have meant to do me harm. The
pistol was loaded with blanks. It may have been his
intention to frighten me.”</p>

<p>Frank was watching Gene closely. It was Skelding’s
first impulse to state that this was the fact, but
it seemed to him that Merriwell’s eyes could look
straight into his heart and detect if he spoke the truth;
so his impulse to try to shelter Defarge in such a manner
quickly left him, and he said:</p>

<p>“The revolver was loaded with ball cartridges originally.
Defarge did not know they had been changed
for blanks.”</p>

<p>“They were changed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“If they had not been you would be a dead man
now, Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how it happened, Skelding.”</p>

<p>Gene glanced toward Defarge, as if he did not like
to talk of it there.</p>

<p>“Look at him,” said Merry. “He is asleep. See&mdash;his
eyes are closing now.”</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand toward Defarge as he
spoke, and the eyes of the mad student drooped and
closed, while he appeared to be fast asleep. Skelding
was awed beyond measure.</p>

<p>“You may speak now,” said Frank. “He will not
hear what you say.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Skelding had seen Defarge become quiet and docile
beneath the steady gaze of Merriwell’s eyes, and he
now understood that Frank had some wonderful
power over the fellow.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Skelding,” Merriwell invited, motioning
toward a chair. “I shall lock the door to keep intruders
away.”</p>

<p>He did so, and found Skelding seated. Merry came
and sat down near, saying:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will be willing to tell me the whole
story. You say Defarge blames me because he failed
in his society ambitions? <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'It that right?'">Is that right?</ins>”</p>

<p>Merry had not spoken of “Bones.” A member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that society never discusses his society outside the
secret rooms of the order.</p>

<p>“That is right. Up to the last minute he believed he
was sure of going to ‘Bones.’ It drove him daffy
when the fifteenth man was chosen and he found himself
ignored. He had been drinking for some time,
and absinth has obtained its hold on him. Since that
he has taken quantities of the stuff, and you see what
the result is.”</p>

<p>“I see,” nodded Frank. “Poor chap! I have a hypnotic
influence over him, Skelding, and that was how
I was able to conquer him as you see. I never knew
I possessed such power till one night a long time ago
when, then crazed by drink, he tried to strike me in
the back with a knife. I held him helpless and looked
deep into his eyes, willing that he should obey me. He
did so, and I found I had power to make him do as I
chose. But I do not believe that any man has a right
under normal circumstances to exercise such a power
over another, and I removed the influence from him.</p>

<p>“For a long time I fancied I would never have further
trouble with him, and I even hoped that, without
another clash, I might make him friendly toward me.
It would have given me satisfaction at one time had
this resulted. But when I came back to Yale this year
I found all the old bitterness in his heart had awakened,
and he tried to injure me once more. Then I
willed that he should be unable to harm me as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
I kept my power over him. Once more, however, I
released him. It must have been since then that he
took to drinking absinth.”</p>

<p>“Something must be done to save him, Merriwell,
or he will be lodged in a madhouse within a week.
But I did not think; perhaps you mean to have him
punished for making an attack on your life? Your
patience with him must be exhausted.”</p>

<p>“I try to hold my patience with a man just as long
as I believe there is any hope for him. But I must confess
that Defarge’s case looks hopeless. You have not
told me, Skelding, how it happened that the cartridges
in his revolver were changed. Who changed them?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“In his room a short time ago. I called there and
found him loading the weapon. From what he said I
knew he meant to try to shoot you. He went out to
the room of another fellow to get a drink. The revolver
lay on the table. Beside the box of ball cartridges
was a box of blanks. While he was gone I exchanged
the ball cartridges for the blanks.”</p>

<p>“And saved my life by doing it. Skelding, you have
been my enemy, but by this one act you have wiped out
all the past. I have thought pretty hard things of you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
but now I am willing to forget everything. Skelding,
we may not become friends, but we can shake hands.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand to Skelding. Gene looked at
it a moment, and then he shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, Merriwell,” he said, making no show of feeling,
although he experienced some, “I’ll not shake
hands with you.”</p>

<p>Frank looked disappointed. He had not expected
this, and a slight flush came to his handsome face.
Skelding saw he had touched Merriwell’s pride, and
he hastened to add:</p>

<p>“It’s because I am not worthy to shake your hand,
Merriwell, that I decline; not because there is any of
the old hatred in my heart. I think that is gone. I’ve
been a pretty mean fellow, and I know it. For a long
time I kept my eyes closed to the fact, but they have
been opened at last.”</p>

<p>Frank wondered if the man was sincere. If so,
there was even more to Skelding than he had fancied.</p>

<p>“But you saved my life,” said Merriwell.</p>

<p>“How do you know it was for that I did it?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was to save my friend from being
hanged. Now you can see it in a different light, Merriwell.
Never mind whether it was for your sake or
for Defarge’s that I changed those cartridges. I did
save your life, and I am going to ask a favor of you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you grant it?”</p>

<p>“It is the foolish man who makes a promise before
he knows what he is promising.”</p>

<p>“It’s not for my sake, but for Defarge’s. He is the
only friend I have left.”</p>

<p>“The only one?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why, there are Chickering and his friends.”</p>

<p>“They are no longer friends of mine.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“I quit them to-night, Merriwell. I have sickened
of them. I do not wish to pose as better than I am,
but I don’t think I ever really belonged to that gang.
I fell in with them and got to going round with them.
To confess the truth, the reason why I stuck to them
was because they hated you. I hated you, also, but not
for the same cause that inspired their hate. I hated
you because I was jealous of you; I confess it. They
hated you because you would have nothing to do with
men of their class. To-night, in Chickering’s room,
I gave the whole bunch a little game of talk that set
them gasping. I told them just what I thought of
them all and that I wanted to never have anything
more to do with them. You may doubt it, Merriwell,
but I am done with all of them for all time.”</p>

<p>“More than ever I feel like offering you my hand,”
exclaimed Frank sincerely. “I tell you now, Skelding,
that I have absolutely no use for the Chickering crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
My friends have accused me of being altogether too
lenient with my enemies; but I think I could not be
lenient with those fellows. My contempt for them is
too great.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” nodded Gene. “They have no
friends among the real men here. They are outcasts.
Unfortunately for me, I was fool enough to get their
brand on me, and I know I’ll never be able to pull
away from it while I am in Yale.”</p>

<p>“You can try,” said Frank encouragingly; “although
a man does find it mighty hard to live down a
bad reputation, and for that very reason may get discouraged.
It is true heroism to keep trying, however.
The fellow who has had a bad name must feel that he
is to blame for it himself, and he should not be disheartened
if every one seems to doubt him when he is doing
his best to be straight. Persistence wins at everything.”</p>

<p>Gene’s face began to take on an expression of eagerness.</p>

<p>“Do you really suppose there is a chance for me?”
he asked. “How can I make friends that are worth
being called friends? The Chickering odium will stick
to me.”</p>

<p>“Show that you have quit them for all time, but
make no talk about it. If you go round telling people
you are done with them, you’ll find you’ll not get much
credit. If you show that you are too eager to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the right sort of friends, you may only succeed in
arousing suspicion and defeating yourself.”</p>

<p>Skelding felt that this was good advice.</p>

<p>“But we’re forgetting Defarge,” he said. “It’s for
him I want you to promise to do something. I know
there is no reason why you should lift your hand for
a man like him, but you may be able to save him from
going to the madhouse.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Your influence&mdash;your power. You understand
what I mean?”</p>

<p>“I think I do. I am willing to try.”</p>

<p>“He must be kept at any cost from drinking absinth.
That is the only thing that can save him. You
can prevent him from taking the stuff and you are the
only one.”</p>

<p>“I understand what you mean. I must command
him to let it alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, that’s it!”</p>

<p>“And that is all the favor you ask of me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are modest, Skelding. For your sake, I’ll try
to save him. I do not believe there is much good in
him, but madness is a terrible thing, and I do not
wish to think of my worst enemy as a lunatic behind
iron bars.”</p>

<p>Skelding was satisfied.</p>

<p>Merriwell rose and moved his chair till it was directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in front of the high-backed chair on which Defarge
was sitting. Then he sat down there, cautioning
Gene to be silent and not interrupt. He next
reached out his hand and touched the slumberer on the
forehead, saying gently:</p>

<p>“Wake up, Defarge!”</p>

<p>Bertrand opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“I wish you to attend closely to what I tell you,”
said Frank. “Do you understand?”</p>

<p>In a mechanical manner Defarge said: “Yes.”</p>

<p>“In the future, Defarge, you cannot drink absinth
in any form. The smell of absinth shall make you
faint or sick. If you lift to your lips a glass containing
the stuff, your fingers shall be unable to hold the
glass, and it shall fall from your hand before you can
drink. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Defarge, in the same mechanical manner.</p>

<p>“Further, for the space of one week, you shall be
unable to do anything to injure me, Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Why only for a week?” whispered Skelding.
“Why not make it forever?”</p>

<p>But it was Frank’s desire to know if in a week’s time
this fellow would be rid of his evil and murderous passions,
or if they would still possess him in full force.</p>

<p>“That is all,” said Merriwell. “When I clap my
hands you will be at liberty again, but you must go
straight to your room, undress, and go to bed. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
will have a good night’s sleep, which will calm your
nerves.”</p>

<p>Then Frank suddenly clapped his hands, and Bertrand
jumped as if he had been shot. He started to
his feet, staring round wildly, his aspect being one of
bewilderment and fear.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” he huskily asked. “Did I
shoot Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Frank, who was standing now.
“As you see, I am all right. You can’t harm me, Defarge.”</p>

<p>The fellow stared at Merry a moment, then shrank
back, lifting his hand.</p>

<p>“Those eyes!” he cried. “It’s no use. I cannot get
away from them! Oh, curse those eyes!”</p>

<p>Then, with a shudder, he turned and walked toward
the door. Frank was there in advance, opening it for
him and letting him out.</p>

<p>Skelding made a move as if to accompany Bertrand,
but Merry said, in a quiet tone:</p>

<p>“There is no need of it. He will go to his room
and go to bed. Let him alone to-night.”</p>

<p>So Bertrand was permitted to depart.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful!” muttered Skelding, in awe. “I
understand now, Merriwell, how it is that you have
such power over everybody.”</p>

<p>“No, you do not,” declared Frank; “for the power
you have witnessed in demonstration to-night is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
I seldom use. Only in desperate emergencies
do I call it to my command. I hope I may never have
to use it again.”</p>

<p>“If you save Defarge it will be a wonderful thing.
I am going, Merriwell. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Skelding. Here is the revolver belonging
to Defarge. Take it away. I don’t want the
thing.”</p>

<p>Skelding took it. He hesitated a moment, tempted
to offer in turn his hand to Merriwell, but did not
do so. Again saying good night, he went out.</p>

<p>The experiences of that night would never be forgotten
by Skelding. At last he understood the full
extent of his past folly in trying to down a man of
such amazing magnetic and mesmeric influence, and he
thanked his lucky stars that Merriwell had not been
a revengeful foe.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">A WILD NIGHT.</span></h2>


<p>It was a strange spectacle. The campus seemed almost
as light as day. Two long lines of men in hoods
and gowns entered from opposite sides and began their
march, loudly singing their society songs.</p>

<p>It was the night of the initiations to the three junior
societies, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Psi Upsilon, and Alpha
Delta Phi. It was a strangely interesting sight, and
crowds had gathered to witness it.</p>

<p>Slowly and with dignity the hooded and gowned
members of the societies marched about the campus.
This part of their doings was intended for the eyes of
the public, but later things would happen within the
solid walls of their society houses that the public had
no hope of witnessing.</p>

<p>What were those things? Who can say? No candidate
who has ever passed through the ordeal ever
opens his lips to tell what happened to him. But certain
it is that within those walls there was a merry old
time that night, for it is there the local burlesque is
given, and this has proved of spicy interest to the general
public, being filtered to the outside world.</p>

<p>This year among the happy candidates were two of
Merriwell’s friends. Jack Ready was one of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“La! la!” he said modestly, as he was congratulated.
“Proclaim not the honor to the world. It will be a
great privilege for the Four Hundred to catch me
when I break away from Yale. Oh, I’m strictly the
thing, and they can’t get along without me.”</p>

<p>“What you really need,” said Greg Carker, “is a
crown. You are a king.”</p>

<p>“A fool’s cap would be better,” grunted Browning,
who had been offering congratulations. “I don’t know
how they ever made the mistake of taking him in, but
I’m glad he’s made it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my fragile friend,” chirped Ready, with
the old-time flirt of his hand. “When I am in need of
a fool’s cap I’ll know where to come for it. Cluck!
cluck! Git ap! My, my, how the wind blows!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have the privilege of hauling you over
the coals to-night!” said Bruce, with a baleful glare
in his eye. “Oh, I wouldn’t do a thing to you! You’ll
get it, anyhow, for they’ll be sure to give you a double
dose to cure your freshness.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” sighed Jack, “it can’t be cured.”</p>

<p>“Try carbolic acid,” suggested Bruce.</p>

<p>Later Ready and Bingham had disappeared, and
their friends knew they were going through the “fiery
ordeal.”</p>

<p>What a wild night it was! Those who have passed
through it know something about the events of that
night. To-day the initiations are far milder than before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the tragedy of Wilkins Rustin in ’92. Rustin
was a fine, athletic fellow. During his initiation he
was blindfolded and told to run at best speed along
an unfrequented street. Being a swift runner, he drew
away from the two men in whose charge he was. They
shouted a cry of warning to him, but this he misunderstood,
and, swerving from a direct course, he ran
into the sharp pole of a wagon. They picked him up,
bleeding and unconscious, and he died from his injuries.</p>

<p>A storm of indignation arose all over the country,
and the faculty came near deciding to wipe out the societies
altogether. It was fortunate for Yale life that
this radical step was not taken. The men in charge of
Rustin were overcome with grief, and their sorrow led
to their acquittal of anything but a charge of grave
folly.</p>

<p>This night of which I write nothing of the kind took
place; but the old members of the society and the newly
elected ones had a jolly time of it. They made a
night of it.</p>

<p>Along toward morning, as it was growing light, the
members of the societies engaged in a wild and weird
game of baseball on the campus. That is, many of
the members of the societies engaged in the game;
but there were many others who curled up in the shelter
of some near-by sheds and serenely fell asleep.</p>

<p>Ready was not one of the sleepers. Bingham would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
have slept, but Jack mauled the big fellow till he got
him out behind the bat, with a bird-cage over his head
for a mask. Jack himself was pitching.</p>

<p>“Look out for my curves,” he advised. “Talk about
Frank Merriwell’s double shoot! Why, I’ve got the
corkscrew ball.”</p>

<p>“I’ve discovered to-night that you have the corkscrew
habit,” rumbled Bingham, trying to make his
queer cage balance on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Put ’em over,” called the batter. “If you hit me,
I’ll bring suit against you for breach of promise.”</p>

<p>It was rather dark, and Ready actually threw a
curve. Fortunately, the ball was about as hard as a
ripe cucumber, for it grazed Bingham’s fingers and
struck the bird-cage a glancing blow, setting it to spinning
about on his shoulders. The batter swiped at it
furiously, and threw himself off his feet onto his back.</p>

<p>The watching crowd was boisterous in its applause.
This was the kind of baseball that filled their hearts
with exceeding great joy at about this hour in the
morning.</p>

<p>“One ball,” decided the umpire, who had closed his
eyes and turned his back.</p>

<p>“One ball!” shouted Ready. “Why, he struck at it,
Mr. Umpire.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t over the plate,” said the umpire, with
dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference. He struck at
it.”</p>

<p>“Be silent,” commanded the umpire. “He had no
business to strike at such a bad one. It is one ball.”</p>

<p>And that decision stood. The next pitched ball
struck the batter in the small of the back.</p>

<p>“Dead ball,” said somebody.</p>

<p>“No; dead man,” said the umpire. “Take him off
the field. Remove the corpse.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried the batter. “I want to get one
crack at that ball. Give me a show.”</p>

<p>“I have declared you dead,” said the umpire; “so
you’ll have to make room for the next man. Drop
that bat and take to your hole, you lobster!”</p>

<p>The next man came up and hit the first ball straight
at Jack, who did not stop it with his hands, but with
the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>“Judgment!” he gasped. “I have it!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the umpire. “Corbett got it
there at Carson City. You’re out.”</p>

<p>“Out?” squealed Jack. “It’s the other man who is
out!”</p>

<p>“I tell you that you are out,” insisted the umpire.
“Get off the grass.”</p>

<p>And Jack was compelled to make room for another
fellow who was ambitious to do some pitching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alas and alack!” he sobbed, as he stood aside. “It
is thus we poor mortals get it in the neck!”</p>

<p>“I thought you got it in the stomach,” said Bingham.</p>

<p>“Only a bird in a gilded cage,” Jack exclaimed,
pointing to the big sophomore.</p>

<p>But the pitching of the new man was of a most terrific
order, and Bingham loudly called for him to “ease
’em over.” The second ball the new man pitched was
a foul tip, which the catcher misjudged, getting it just
where Ready had received the batted ball.</p>

<p>Over on his back rolled Bingham, while the crowd
whooped with joy and danced grotesquely in the gray
morning twilight.</p>

<p>“Drag off the dead,” solemnly ordered the umpire.</p>

<p>Jack Ready rushed in, caught Bingham by the heels
and started with him, dragging the big fellow along on
his back. He succeeded in pulling Bingham for at
least a rod before the fellow recovered enough to kick
him off.</p>

<p>“Hey!” roared Ralph, as he sent Ready reeling.
“What in thunder do you take me for, you jackass?
Think I’m a dump-cart? Is that why you promptly
harnessed yourself into the thills?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me!” chirped Jack, standing off and surveying
the other with comical gravity. “I thought you
were dead, and I was on the way to the dumping-grounds
with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll find I’m not dead!” snapped Bingham, as
he got up and made a dive for Jack.</p>

<p>“I surrender!” Ready helplessly cried, throwing up
his hands. “I might escape you by running, but the
effort is too great.”</p>

<p>“You can’t run,” declared Ralph, as he grasped the
joker.</p>

<p>“I know it. I have discovered something that can
outrun me or any other man living. I’m going to enter
it in all the races this season.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“A gas-meter.”</p>

<p>Bingham thumped Jack.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to pay for this coat,” he declared.
“You tore it when you pulled me along.”</p>

<p>“Where did I tear it?”</p>

<p>“Why, on the back, of course.”</p>

<p>“And you were on the part that was torn. Oh,
well, you are used to that. You often get on a
tear.”</p>

<p>Then, with their arms about each other, they stood
and gazed on that wild and grotesque game of ball. It
was a hilarious spectacle, to say the least, and all the
rules of baseball were ignored and violated by both
players and umpire. In fact, the closer the players
stuck to the regular game the greater penalties the umpire
put upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Arm-in-arm, Bingham and Ready entered the neighboring
shed, where they saw dark forms stretched
about.</p>

<p>“Behold!” said Jack, in a hoarse whisper. “This is a
battle-field, and here are the slain who by the ruthless
enemy have been shot.”</p>

<p>“I’m only half-shot,” declared one of the sleepers,
sitting up in a dusky corner. “Gimme ’nother drink.”</p>

<p>Then another sat up and began to sing in a wild and
weird manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“How dry I am! How dry I am!</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord only knows how dry I am!</p>
<p class="verse0">I want a drink, I want it now!</p>
<p class="verse6">How dry I am!</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord only knows, how dry I am!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>One by one the others roused up and joined in the
singing, sitting there in the gloom, some swaying
slightly, some holding themselves rigidly straight on
account of the queer feelings in their heads.</p>

<p>It was a strange sight, and the hoarse, tuneless
chanting sounded like a funeral dirge.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” grunted one fellow, who had refused to
sit up. He put his hands over his ears and tried to
go on sleeping.</p>

<p>The singing&mdash;if singing it could be called&mdash;continued
in the same dirgelike strain.</p>

<p>“We’ll see if we can’t accommodate you,” murmured
Ready, who had found in a corner of the shed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
hose used for washing wagons. Investigation showed
that the water could be turned on in that corner. Jack
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'shut the nozle'">shut the nozzle</ins> and turned the water on. Then he was
ready.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“How dry I am! How dry I am!</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord only knows, how dry I am!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>“Perhaps this will wet you down a little,” observed
Ready, as he calmly turned on the hose and let drive
at the crowd.</p>

<p>Swish! spat! spatter!</p>

<p>The water flew, the singing stopped, the men
shrieked, and there was a wild scramble to get away.</p>

<p>“It’s a cloudburst!” yelled somebody.</p>

<p>“Help! help! Fire!” cried another.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness!” gasped another. “That stuff
struck me in the mouth just as I was singing. I’ve
swallowed more than a gallon of real water. It’ll be
fatal!”</p>

<p>They made a wild scramble to get out of the shed.
Some of them got up and ran; others crawled as fast
as they could on their hands and knees. And all the
while Ready continued to serenely play the hose upon
them.</p>

<p>Not one stopped to investigate, for that water was
“cold and wet.” It was too much for their nerves. In
a very few minutes Ready had cleared the shed. As
the last of them went out, he dropped the hose and ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
after them, wringing his hands and pretending that
he had been driven out with the others.</p>

<p>He left Bingham in the shed roaring with laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, my!” gurgled Jack, as he came tearing
out into the midst of the water-dripping crowd, “and I
was having such a lovely dream! What happened,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“The waterworks exploded!” declared one drenched
fellow, wringing water out of his coat and wiping it
out of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it awful!” gasped Ready.</p>

<p>“Hush!” commanded one. “Listen!”</p>

<p>Bingham was heard laughing in the shed.</p>

<p>“’Sdeath!” panted Ready.</p>

<p>“’Sblood!” hissed another fellow.</p>

<p>“Somebody turned that water on us!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed Jack excitedly. “The wretch
who did it is in there now!”</p>

<p>“He must die!” savagely howled one of the wet
chaps. “I am ready to kill him with my faithful boot-jack!”</p>

<p>“He must suffer!” they all declared. “Who dares
go in there and capture the wretch?”</p>

<p>“Wait,” advised Ready. “He’ll come out, and then
we can pounce upon him.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, Bingham came strolling out of
the shed, still shaking with laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“At him!” hissed Jack, and they flung themselves
upon him.</p>

<p>“To the stake!” snarled one.</p>

<p>“What stake?” asked another.</p>

<p>“Mistake,” chuckled Ready, to himself.</p>

<p>Then he plunged into the thickest of it, yelling for
them to give the wretch some of his own medicine.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Bingham. “What are you going
to do? Hold on!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Jack. “We won’t let go of
you. There is no reason why you should worry about
that.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Bingham again.</p>

<p>“Give you your just deserts, base-born wretch!”
cried Ready. “Didst think to escape retribution?”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t done anything! It wasn’t me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t think to deceive us with thy false tales.”</p>

<p>“But you know I didn’t do a thing, Ready! Why,
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jack, however, raised such a racket that Bingham’s
words were drowned and the big fellow was dragged
back into the shed, where the hose was found on the
ground, still hissing and squirting.</p>

<p>Two men who had been drenched volunteered to
hold Bingham. A dozen were eager to play the hose.
They gave it to him at once. He ducked his head,
and the water struck him under his collar at the back
of his neck and poured down his back. It seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
take the strength out of him and leave him gasping and
helpless for the moment. Then that cold and chilling
stream played all over him.</p>

<p>Jack Ready stood aside, his hands clasped, a look of
sadness on his face and deep joy in his heart.</p>

<p>“It is ever thus,” he said to himself, “that the innocent
man ever gets it in the neck, while the other
chap gets off and becomes a hero. Let this be a lesson
to you, Jack, my boy, to always take care not to
be the innocent one.”</p>

<p>They did not let up on Bingham till the big soph
was drenched to the skin and in a furious mood. He
broke away from the fellows who were holding him
and rushed from the shed, vowing he would murder
Ready on sight.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a lovely time to-night,” whispered Jack
still to himself; “but something tells me that I had
better fade away. Here is where I fade.”</p>

<p>He managed to escape from the shed, round which
he stole, making off into the gloom. At a distance,
watching the men near the shed, stood a lonely figure.
Jack drew near and saw it was Bertrand Defarge.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PROMISE.</span></h2>


<p>A little farther on Ready came upon another man,
who seemed to be watching Defarge. It was Hock
Mason.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mason!” exclaimed Ready. “Why art thou
not wrapped in the arms of old Morpheus? At this
witching hour you should be snoring sweetly.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been watching him,” said Mason, motioning
toward Defarge.</p>

<p>“All night?”</p>

<p>“A large part of it.”</p>

<p>“Why should you take all that trouble?”</p>

<p>“Because I feared he might commit suicide before
morning.”</p>

<p>“Suicide?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“He was pretty wild last night. I saw him trying to
drink absinth.”</p>

<p>“Trying?”</p>

<p>“I said that.”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t he succeed?”</p>

<p>“No, sah.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the strange part of it. I can’t tell why. He
was crazy for a drink of the stuff, but the odor of it
seemed to make him weak and helpless. Then, when
he tried to lift the glass quickly and drink it off without
stopping, the glass fell from his fingers just before
it reached his lips. Three times he tried it, and three
times he dropped the glass, which was shattered on the
floor.”</p>

<p>“He must have found that drink expensive when
he did get it.”</p>

<p>“But he did not get it.”</p>

<p>“No? Did he call the game off?”</p>

<p>“He gave up in despair. He paid for all the stuff,
declaring that Merriwell’s eyes had kept him from
drinking. Then, in a sort of frenzy, he rushed out of
the place. I thought he might do himself harm, and I
followed him up. From place to place he went, trying
everywhere to get the stuff. When he did get it and
tried to drink it, the same thing happened to him again
and again. I tell you he became desperate. Then he got
out into the night and tore away. I followed him up,
meaning to try to prevent in case he attempted to
drown himself. I think he did have some such
thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Mason,” said Ready, putting a hand on the shoulder
of the man from the South, “I have always regarded
you as a fellow with horse sense.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sah,” said Hock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I find,” Jack gravely added, “that I have made
a mistake. You are a chump.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what, sah?” gasped Mason.</p>

<p>“Any man who will contemplate getting wet to
prevent Bertrand Defarge from committing suicide is
a chump,” Ready gravely declared.</p>

<p>Mason was angry, but he saw something in the face
of the queer sophomore that prevented him from losing
control of his temper.</p>

<p>“But, sah,” said the youth from South Carolina,
“you do not know how much he counted on an election
which did not come to him. I know all about it,
for I was with him tap day. The hand that fell on
my back was the hand he thought must tap him.”</p>

<p>“Which shows that he got just what was due him,
my dear Mason. It’s not your place to worry over
him in the least, and I think you have been wasting
your valuable time chasing him about. Time, you
know, is a precious jewel, and the man who wastes it
when he can sleep or loaf makes an awful mistake.
Come, Hocksie, let’s perambulate toward our boudoirs
and prepare for chapel. Forget it, my boy. Let Defarge
take care of himself.”</p>

<p>So Jack dragged Mason away, and they left Defarge
standing there alone in the gray light of morning.</p>

<p>It had, in truth, been a wild night for Bertrand, but
now the intense longing for absinth had passed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
him, a grateful quietness had come upon him, and
something seemed to tell him that never again would
he be tempted to drink the stuff that was dragging him
to destruction.</p>

<p>He went back to his room, but not to sleep, for
Skelding soon followed him. Several times that night
Gene had visited the room of Defarge, only to find the
fellow out, and it was his fear that the influence of
Merriwell had failed, in which case Bertrand might
return a raving maniac. He was relieved when he
found Defarge sitting there by the window in the
morning light, quiet and calm, and unexcited.</p>

<p>Of course, Defarge was astonished when Gene appeared
at that hour. Skelding told him how it happened
that he was there.</p>

<p>“Well, I have had a bad night of it,” confessed
Bertrand. “I was seized by a mad desire for that stuff
last night, but the strange thing was that I could not
drink it, no matter how hard I tried.”</p>

<p>Gene nodded, smiling.</p>

<p>“At first,” Bertrand went on, “the smell of it made
me so sick and faint that I could not get the glass to
my lips.”</p>

<p>Again Gene nodded.</p>

<p>“But I felt that I must have it. So, holding it off at
arm’s length at first, I lifted it quickly, meaning to
dash it down at a swallow.”</p>

<p>“Then what happened?” asked Skelding eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“The glass fell from my fingers every time before
I could touch it to my lips. I can’t understand why it
happened, but it fell and was broken on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Then you were saved?”</p>

<p>“Yes, though I was forced at last to roam about
through the city for hours. Toward morning a strange
calmness came over me, and I knew all desire for that
stuff had passed away. I believe it has left me forever.”</p>

<p>“In which case, you have Frank Merriwell to thank
that you are not now a murderer and a maniac.”</p>

<p>Defarge stared and lifted his hand.</p>

<p>“Not Merriwell, but you,” he said. “You told me
that you exchanged those cartridges.”</p>

<p>“That time, yes; but had you continued to drink
that stuff you would have made the attempt again
at another time, and I might not have been around.”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t I continue to drink?”</p>

<p>“Because Merriwell would not let you.”</p>

<p>Then Skelding told Defarge how Frank had willed
that his enemy should not be able to drink absinth in
any form, and how just what Merriwell had ordered
had come true.</p>

<p>“You can see what you owe to him,” said Skelding.
“You hate him; you regard him as your enemy;
yet he has saved you from a madhouse.”</p>

<p>Bertrand sat there, gazing out of the window in
silence. It was hard for him to think that he owed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
so much to the fellow whom he had hated so intensely
and tried to injure so repeatedly.</p>

<p>“I have been Merriwell’s enemy myself,” Skelding
went on. “It was a long time before I saw the folly
of my ways, but the truth came to me at last. I am
not his friend now, for I would not ask him to be a
friend to me; but I have buried the past, and I shall
never lift a hand against him again. Why don’t you
do the same, Defarge? You can see how hopeless it
is for you to try to injure him. He has the power to
control you when you are away from him. It is your
duty to go to him and confess that you have done
wrong, and thank him for saving you by the spell
he cast on you.”</p>

<p>Defarge shook his head.</p>

<p>“I can’t do that!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I can never humble myself to him.”</p>

<p>“It is not humbling yourself when you thank a
man, be he friend or foe, for such a favor. Look here,
Defarge, you have not many friends in college, have
you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“We might become friends. We both desire some
one whom we can regard as such. But, as I have forever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
renounced all intention of harming or trying to
harm Merriwell, I cannot be the friend of any one who
is plotting him injury. You have your choice now.
Be a man and do the right thing with Merriwell and I
will stick by you. If you do not&mdash;well, we can’t have
much of anything to do with each other. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to think it over,” said Bertrand. “I’m
tired now.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Gene, preparing to go. “I hope
you’ll come to your senses.”</p>

<p>He went out, leaving Defarge staring through the
window at the pink of the morning sky.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, and somehow the passionate
French youth felt that a brighter and better
morning was breaking within his soul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Frank was surprised when Defarge came to him and
said:</p>

<p>“Merriwell, I have no hope that you will believe me,
but I have come to say that in the future I hope God
will punish me if I lift my hand against you, or plot
with others to do you harm!”</p>

<p>Frank turned those wonderful eyes on Defarge, and
saw that the young Frenchman was never more in
earnest.</p>

<p>“I should not have come here to say this,” Bertrand
confessed, “if it had not been for Skelding. He tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
me you have kept me from drinking absinth. I believe
the craving for the stuff has gone from me forever.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be sure of that,” said Merry.</p>

<p>“I know it, and for that reason I wish now to ask
you to hold me fast yet a while longer under the spell.
Keep me from drinking the stuff. Can you?”</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>“Will you do that? You know I was crazed by it
when I tried to shoot you! You know I am pretty
humble now, else I’d not be here asking a favor! I
am sorry for the past&mdash;I swear I am! Do you believe
me, Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe you.”</p>

<p>“And you will still help me? You will keep me
from drinking absinth if I am tempted?”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Frank.</p>

<span class="fs70">PASSING OF AN EARTHQUAKE.</span></h2>


<p>“Hello, Bing!” cried Jack Ready, as Ralph Bingham,
the big sophomore, drifted into Merriwell’s room,
a few days after his victory over Defarge.</p>

<p>“Nice old gal you had out to sup last night after
the opera. Theatrical dame, wasn’t she? Belonged
to the chorus, I should judge.”</p>

<p>“What the dickens makes you think so?” demanded
Ralph, hardly pleased. “Did she look like a chorus
girl?”</p>

<p>“Well, she looked something like a chorus lady,”
chirped Jack. “Somebody told me she lowered the
curtain the night Lincoln was shot.”</p>

<p>Bingham glared, while the others chuckled, with
the exception of Ready himself, who looked very grave
and innocent.</p>

<p>“You’ll get salted some time!” growled the big
sophomore. “You need it, too, for you’re awfully
fresh.”</p>

<p>“Sorry I can’t say the same about the ancient maid
you were blowing to birds and fizz last eve, Bing, old
mark,” purred Ready.</p>

<p>“She was simply an old flame of mine,” asserted
Ralph, finding a seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought so when I saw her hair,” nodded Jack.
“I cried: ‘Fire, fire!’ Gamp was with me, and he
says: ‘Wh-wh-wh-where is the fuf-fuf-fuf-fire?’ Then
I pointed out your old flame.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me that she said something when
she looked up and saw you and Gamp approaching,”
observed Bingham carelessly.</p>

<p>“What did she say?” eagerly asked Jack, hastening
to put his foot into the trap.</p>

<p>“She said: ‘Hello! things are coming my way,’”
answered the satisfied sophomore, crossing his legs.</p>

<p>Then the entire party shouted with laughter, for it
was not often that Ready, the practical joker, was
caught in such an easy manner.</p>

<p>“Language fails me!” declared Ready, as the laughter
lulled. “I’m like the old tramp I saw to-day. Fellows,
he was a finely educated man, and he could speak
five different languages, yet he confessed to me that
his downfall was brought upon him because he did
not know how to say one common little English word
of two letters.”</p>

<p>“What rot!” grunted Browning, from the couch.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” asserted Jack, with great earnestness.
“Drunkenness made him a vagabond, and he became a
drunkard just because he could not say that one little
word of two letters.”</p>

<p>“And he could speak five different languages?” incredulously
asked Carson, from his corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“He could.”</p>

<p>“And the word of two letters was a simple English
word?” broke in Greg Carker.</p>

<p>“So I stated.”</p>

<p>“Dud-dud-dud-did he have an impup-pup-pup-pediment
in his sus-sus-sus-speech?” inquired Joe Gamp
seriously.</p>

<p>“Not the least.”</p>

<p>“Well, what word was it that caused his downfall
because he didn’t know how to say it?” asked Bingham
impatiently.</p>

<p>“It was the word ‘No,’” explained Ready.</p>

<p>“There are lots of men right here at Yale who do
not know how to say that word,” asserted Frank, who
had been listening to the chatter of the others.</p>

<p>“Alas! too true,” sighed Ready. “Now, there’s Carker,
who bunks with me in Durfee. I’ve seen the time
when he found great difficulty in correctly pronouncing
numerous words in the English language.”</p>

<p>“You’re another!” exclaimed Greg warmly.</p>

<p>“The earthquake rumbles,” grunted Browning.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” asserted Ready, with assumed earnestness.
“Why, I remember the night he came in at two
o’clock, walking cross-legged and stumbling over his
own feet. He knew my virtuous abhorrence of such
conduct, and he was naturally a trifle timid. I sat up
and sternly said: ‘Carker, what is the meaning of this?
You have been drinking’. Then he steadied himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with considerable trouble, and answered: ‘’Tain’t sho!
I’m all ri’, thash whas I am. Nozzen massher wish
me.’ ‘If you haven’t been drinking,’ said I, ‘why do
you talk as if you had your mouth full of mush?’
‘Caush,’ said he, ‘a shoft anshwer turnsh away wrath,
ol’ boy.’ Then he lost his balance, fell down, and
drove his head under the bookcase so hard that I had
to take all the books off the shelves and lift the bookcase
before I could get him out.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Greg stiffly, in the face of their
grins, “the man who will believe him on oath is an
idiot, and so his lies do not worry me in the least.”</p>

<p>But Carker could not take a joke pleasantly, and the
laughter of the others caused him to flush and look
disturbed.</p>

<p>“Frivolous&mdash;all frivolous!” he exclaimed. “That’s
the way with Americans to-day. They laugh and
joke, regardless of the fact that the country is making
gigantic strides toward imperialism&mdash;regardless of the
fact that every sign points to the setting up of an empire&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Which shall be overthrown by your own pet earthquake,
Carker,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Even you, Merriwell,” cried Greg&mdash;“you do not
seem willing to take life earnestly.”</p>

<p>“I am not willing to take life at all, my dear boy.
I wouldn’t even kill a cat&mdash;unless she disturbed my
slumbers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s it!” Carker ejaculated, with a despairing
gesture. “You pervert my meaning! You are not
willing to look a thing squarely in the face. That
same frivolous disposition possesses all the young men
of our land who find themselves in fairly comfortable
circumstances. They take no thought of the burdens
of the poor and oppressed. They give no heed to the
groans of the great mass of downtrodden slaves who
are laboring for day pay at starvation wages.”</p>

<p>“He’s off!” cried Ready. “Cluk! cluk! git ap!”</p>

<p>Carker had risen to his feet. Having found an opportunity
to launch forth on his pet hobby, he gave no
heed to any interruption. Without noticing Ready in
the least, he went on, his pale face flushing and his
eyes glowing as his earnestness increased:</p>

<p>“But it is not altogether the young who are thus
heedless of the storm-clouds gathering over our fair
land. It is not altogether the rich. The great middle
class seem just as careless. The moaning and the
groaning of the shackled slaves of toil and oppression
disturb them not. The muttering thunder behind the
rising storm-cloud falls on deaf ears.”</p>

<p>“Get your umbrellas, fellows!” whispered Ready
hoarsely. “We’re going to have a shower this time.
The earthquake has a day off.”</p>

<p>“False prophets tell of growing prosperity and better
times coming. They are liars, and sons of liars!” cried
Carker, becoming more and more impassioned as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
proceeded. “Already the common people are writhing
in the grasp of the gigantic monopolies, which threaten
to crush the life out of our nation. Already the tide
of discontent is beating with threatening throbs against
the sea-wall of money power.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! it’s a tidal wave!” gasped Jack. “And
I do not own a pair of rubber boots!”</p>

<p>“There’s rubber enough in your neck to make several
pairs,” said Bingham.</p>

<p>“Look at the great trusts that are forming to
squeeze the people!” the oratorical youth pursued,
pointing tragically with one quivering finger. “Behold
them in all their brutal insolence and contempt
for the poor wretches they are bleeding! Tell me of
one man connected with a trust who ever did a truly
great, unselfish, and generous thing.”</p>

<p>“Carnegie,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Bah!” exploded Greg. “Who knows the hidden
meaning behind his seeming acts of munificence? Perhaps
it is a blind to deceive the restless common people
and lull their suspicions so that the great trust may
continue to squeeze them still more. Besides, it is
bread the masses are crying for, and he gives them a
stone in the shape of a book.”</p>

<p>“Men do not live by bread alone,” reminded Frank.</p>

<p>“But it is bread the great masses must have,” asserted
Carker. “What time has the slave of day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
toil for reading? When he is not working, he must
be sleeping.”</p>

<p>“Or drinking beer,” murmured Ready. “If he had
sense enough to keep away from the saloons and save
his money, he might not be such a downtrodden
wretch.”</p>

<p>At this Frank nodded. He knew there was more
or less truth in what Carker was saying in such a
theatrical manner; and, at the same time, he was aware
that Ready had struck the key of the cause for more
than half the poverty and wretchedness of the poor.</p>

<p>“What we need&mdash;&mdash;” Carker tried to go on.</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash;is more saloons,” chuckled Ready. “Give the
poor, downtrodden laborer a chance to blow in every
dollar he earns.”</p>

<p>“The saloon is the poor man’s club,” asserted Greg.</p>

<p>“It’s the club with which he is beating out his own
brains,” said Merriwell seriously.</p>

<p>Carker gasped a little, but he quickly recovered and
swung off again:</p>

<p>“Because the poor man seeks to find a vent for
his feelings by drinking occasionally in a saloon, the
man of the upper class points the finger of scorn at
him, crying out that the poor wretch has brought about
his own misfortune. What would the poor man do
if he didn’t have a chance to drink in saloons?”</p>

<p>“Save his money and make his family comfortable,”
answered Frank promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Comfortable! comfortable!” sneered Greg. “And
he would see the rich man who employed him rolling
in luxury, living like a prince by the money the poor
man had toiled to earn. It’s true! You all know it’s
true. The laborer might be able to hold soul and body
together, but none of the real pleasures of life could
be his. No wonder the great masses are murmuring
and groaning! Their hearts are eaten by a consuming
fire that shall burst forth with all the fury of Vesuvius&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'My goodnes!'">My goodness!</ins> it’s a volcano!” whispered Ready.
“That’s hot stuff!”</p>

<p>“I’m not a drinker,” Carker asserted, “but I claim
the right to take a drink when I like. In hot weather
I do like beer, and I take it sometimes. Shall I say
to the poor man: ‘This is not for you; I alone may
have beer?’ The folly of it! I have sympathy with a
poor man. My father was poor when he started out
in life, and I am proud of it. He was a cooper.”</p>

<p>“Well, he put a mighty poor head into one beer-barrel,”
said Ready, jerking his thumb significantly
toward Greg.</p>

<p>This caused a burst of laughter, but Carker pretended
that he had not heard it.</p>

<p>“The poor man of America is ambitious when he
starts out in life,” the young socialist continued. “It
is only after he has labored for years, and seen how
fruitless is the result of his toil, that ambition is crushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
from his soul. But the place of ambition is taken by
a terrible thing&mdash;a feeling of hatred toward the rich.
This feeling is growing day by day all over our land,
and it causes the murmur that we hear growing louder
and louder. If we pause to listen, we may hear it distinctly;
we may even feel the ground shake a little beneath
our feet.”</p>

<p>“By heavens! the earthquake is coming, after all!”
sobbed Ready, dropping limply on a chair.</p>

<p>“The rich man in his carriage does not feel the
slight tremor,” Greg spouted; “or, if he does, he smiles
and says it means nothing. He may have noticed
something of the kind before. If so, it lulled, and the
threatened shock did not come, which leads him to
think it will never come. Poor fool! Often in earthquake
countries, before the coming of the mighty
shock, there are slight warning tremors of the earth.
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'These litle quivers'">These little quivers</ins> may do no harm, or they may
simply crack a few buildings, just to show what they
can do when they get into action. At last comes the
great shock, and the earth opens to swallow up whole
cities, the sea rolls in upon the land, buildings topple
and fall, flames burst forth, and the scene is the most
awful mortal man can behold.”</p>

<p>All were silent now, their eyes closed, their positions
seeming to indicate resignation.</p>

<p>“Thus it will be in the terrible hour when the earthquake
shall shake our mighty land. The downtrodden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
masses shall upheave like the rising waves of the
tidal sea! The temples of the rich shall come toppling
down with crashing thunder! Havoc and ruin shall
spread from ocean to ocean! The sky shall be darkened
by an ascending cloud of black smoke rising from
the palacelike homes of millionaires! That day shall
be even more terrible than those of the Commune. The
cries of the victims shall be drowned by&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this point Browning snored loudly from the
couch, Ready followed suit from his chair, and the
sound seemed to echo all round the room. Carker
paused and looked about, seeing that every one but
himself seemed to be sound asleep. His face became
still more flushed than before, and he sat down suddenly
on his chair, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Jack Ready stirred a little, opened his eyes, yawned,
sat up, and called:</p>

<p>“Wake up, fellows! The earthquake is over.”</p>

<span class="fs70">FRANK HAS A SCHEME.</span></h2>


<p>“Fellows,” said Frank, “now that the earthquake
has passed, let’s talk about something more interesting.
You know to-night is the night we celebrate Omega
Lambda Chi.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” cried Ready, with a flirt of his hand; “I’ll
be there. Oh, the poor freshmen!”</p>

<p>“Bub-by gum!” chuckled Gamp. “We’re gug-gug-gug-goin’
to have a circus this year. I hear the fuf-fuf-fuf-freshmen
are onto all our tut-tut-tricks, and
they sus-sus-say the sophs are gug-gug-gug-goin’ to
get it in the neck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know!” chirped Ready. “I think the
sophs are able to look out for the freshies.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll never trap them unless somebody leads
them into the snare,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Wait and see. They are a particularly innocent lot
this year.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it looks to you, but I think, as a
class, they are even more up to snuff than usual.”</p>

<p>“Come off! Why, last year&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You were a freshman, Ready, and you bit a number
of well-baited hooks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did I? He, he! Well, I fancy some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
people were bitten on a few occasions. I remember
a certain delightful evening when a party took me
out to give me a little haze. I believe I was put in
with a skeleton, and I went mad while confined there.
Oh, say! Merriwell, you were a mark that night!”</p>

<p>Frank colored a little as he laughingly confessed:</p>

<p>“You did fool me, all right, Ready; but you would
have fooled anybody, for you played mad to perfection.
We all thought we had driven you crazy.”</p>

<p>“I played mad, but there was no play about your
madness when you found you were fooled. Oh, ha,
ha, ha! It makes me laugh to think what a great
time I had!”</p>

<p>“Forget it!” cried Frank, also laughing.</p>

<p>“How can I?”</p>

<p>“Just do. I never tried to get square, have I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never! That seemed to teach you the folly of
trying to monkey with little Jack.”</p>

<p>“Conceit!” muttered Bingham. “You need some of
it taken out of you.”</p>

<p>“Perchance thou art right, but I’m a bettor that
finds no takers, and, therefore, I’m much better than
my associates. Git ap!”</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell’s eyes twinkled, and a sudden resolve
took possession of him.</p>

<p>“We’re all going to have a hand in the festivities to-night,”
he said. “But I hear there is one man among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
them who has somehow got onto the usual order of
things, and means to make a diversion.”</p>

<p>“Is it Morgan?” asked Ready.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then it must be Starbright,” said Mason.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But they are the two leaders of the freshmen,” asserted
Bingham. “First one seems to be the leader,
and then the other bobs up. It’s impossible to tell
just who is the cock of the walk in that class.”</p>

<p>“This time a new man has come to the front,” said
Merry.</p>

<p>“Not Dashleigh?” grunted Browning. “That fellow
never was cut out for a leader.”</p>

<p>“No, he is not the one.”</p>

<p>“Can’t guess who it is, then.”</p>

<p>“It’s Boltwood.”</p>

<p>“What? That fellow with the long hair?”</p>

<p>“Same.”</p>

<p>“Get out!”</p>

<p>“Fact.”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s fruit!” chuckled Ready. “He thinks he’s
a poet. Oh, he, he, he! Why, he’s a guy!”</p>

<p>“Nice built fellow,” observed Carson. “Looks like
he might become an athlete.”</p>

<p>“But he’s soft as mush,” said Ready. “He never
takes any training, and a kid can handle him.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Frank, in a peculiar manner, “I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a fancy that he is not so easy as you think, and I’ve
been told that he’s onto the usual event in the Pass of
Thermopylæ, and has a counter trick in store for the
sophs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, has he?” exclaimed Ready warmly. “Well,
we’ll have to look out for Mr. Rolf Boltwood.”</p>

<p>“I have a plan,” said Frank, still with a queer
twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Unfold it, oh, mighty one!” urged Jack.</p>

<p>“Why not fool the freshmen completely by causing
Boltwood to fail to put in an appearance? We’re all
looking for the thing to come off right to-night, and
we don’t want any one to spoil the plans.”</p>

<p>Ready placed his forefinger gently on his forehead
and seemed buried in profound thought.</p>

<p>“Is it worth the trouble?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course. You don’t know what sort of a game
he may have planned. Thus far, I think, he has not
revealed it to any one, fearing it might get out in
some way. If you delay, it may be too late. I think
it is understood that he is to be the leader of the
freshmen on this occasion. If he vanishes, somebody
else will take his place, and all will go merrily as a
marriage-bell.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right,” nodded Ready. “Somehow,
I rather fancy the adventure. Who is with me?”</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose you can count me in,” said Bingham.
“But how is it to be done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Boltwood is mashed on one of those chorus girls,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“Know her name?”</p>

<p>“Lotta.”</p>

<p>“Lotta what?”</p>

<p>“Lotta trouble, perhaps. Never mind her last name;
Lotta, Lottie, or Tottie will go.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the play?”</p>

<p>“With the aid of Lotta’s magic name, he may be
lured away.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Lotta can write him a little note, you know, asking
him to meet her.”</p>

<p>“It’s too late for that now.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. The note can be written at once.
Wait; I’ll do it. He has never seen her handwriting.
I can imitate the writing of a girl, I fancy. Where
is the company stopping?”</p>

<p>“Lots of the chorus hang out at the Tontine,” said
Bingham. “My charming friend hangs up her hat
there.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s likely Lotta stops there. That’s good
luck, for there is no trouble in getting some Tontine
stationery. Get into this thing, Carker, and stop
listening for the rumbling of that earthquake. Hustle
over to the Tontine and get me some paper and envelopes.
While you are about it, call a cab and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
it stand at the corner of Temple and Elm. Get a
closed cab, with curtains.”</p>

<p>“Ye gods!” cried Ready; “I scent a frolic! Let
Carker get the paper and envelopes; I’ll attend to the
cab.”</p>

<p>“All right. Hustle along in a lively fashion, for
there is no time to spare. Have you a nice, safe place
to lodge Boltwood this evening till the festivities are
over?”</p>

<p>“Have we? Ask me! Didn’t we keep Earl Knight
safe and snug when we had him? Oh, we can enclose
Boltie in a dungeon cell, and he can enjoy himself
reciting poems to the bare walls. La, la! There is
something doing, and little Jack is himself again!”</p>

<p>Ready grabbed Carker by the collar and yanked
him out of the room in a hurry.</p>

<p>“Bingham,” said Frank, “locate Boltwood, and report
here as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” sang out the big sophomore, and
away he went.</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind Bingham, Frank
looked around. There were no more sophomores in
the room, and he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he said, “somebody is going to be surprised
to-night. This is going to be a regular circus.”</p>

<p>“What’s the game?” asked Mason, tumbling that
Merry was up to some kind of a trick. “Let us in.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” answered Frank, shaking his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
“But watch out for a surprise this evening. Don’t
say a word. Jack Ready will be the leader of the
sophomores, and he expects to have everything his own
way. Oh, it will be a great celebration of Omega
Lambda Chi, if nothing goes crooked.”</p>

<p>And that was all he would say.</p>

<p>Carker came back with the paper and envelopes, and
Merry at once sat down to write the decoy letter.
By the time it was finished, Ready showed up, announcing
that the cab was waiting at the corner.
Then Bingham came in and said that Boltwood was in
his room, writing a sonnet to Lotta’s ear.</p>

<p>Frank read the decoy letter, which ran like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Boltwood</span>: Since we parted last night
something very surprising has happened. I have received
a letter from my dear mama, telling me that my
Aunt Kitty has died and left me a fortune if I will
leave the stage. Isn’t that just perfectly lovely? And
still, I shall so hate to give up my career and relinquish
my art. But we’re all out for the dust, and sometimes
the ghost fails to walk, which makes us warm
under the lapels of our sealskins. With the money
dear old Aunt Kit has left to me, I can raise quite a
breeze.</p>

<p>“I am going home to-morrow, but before I go I
wish to see once more the friend who recited such
beautiful poetry last evening. I could not go away
without seeing you, Mr. Boltwood. It can only be for
a few minutes, as I have to play to-night. The messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
who brings this will take you to where I am
waiting in a cab. Do come at once, dear boy! If I
only had some of Aunt Kit’s dough now, I’d square
myself with you for the feed you gave me last night.
Don’t fail me, dear Mr. Boltwood. Yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="right smcap">“Lotta.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Will that do?” asked Frank. “I’m afraid it is
not quite consistent in this, but I don’t think Boltwood
will have time to analyze it, or even to scrutinize it
closely, so I hope he’ll not notice any little breaks.”</p>

<p>“It’s artistic,” declared Ready enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Hardly that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is! That stuff about the ghost walking,
and about giving up her career and her art, is simply
great!”</p>

<p>“And being out for the dust isn’t bad!” chuckled
Bingham. “I notice the most of them are looking
for geldt.”</p>

<p>“Did your aged lady friend try to hit you up for
a sawbuck last evening?” inquired Ready, with an
innocent look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” cried the big sophomore indignantly.
“She was an exception. She follows the stage
for her health.”</p>

<p>“Well, she must have been at it long enough to have
glorious good health.”</p>

<p>“She’s only eighteen.”</p>

<p>“Eighteen?” said Jack. “That’s a one and an eight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
The figures will hit her all right if you put the eight
first.”</p>

<p>“She’s just a foolish little society girl, who thought
it would be a grand thing to give up her life as a gay
butterfly and follow a career.”</p>

<p>“Society girl!” chirped Ready. “La, la! She must
have been one of the Hogan’s Alley four hundred.
Following a career, is she? Oh, lud! oh, lud! I don’t
wonder the career is trying to run away. Anything
would run from that face of hers.”</p>

<p>“She’s highly educated. You should have heard
her quote from the classics.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet she did! Took the choice passages right
out of George Ade’s ‘Fables in Slang.’ My, my!
but she’s the real thing, Bing! But never, never venture
to take her to a dog-fight. She’ll scare the dogs
into fits and break up the whole shooting-match.”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” laughed Frank. “We are losing
time. Here is the precious missive.”</p>

<p>“Precious missive is great!” chuckled Ready.</p>

<p>“Take it, hustle out, get a messenger-boy, give him
instructions, and wait for Boltwood inside the cab.
Be sure to get the fellow in.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to us,” chuckled Ready. “We’ll take
him in!”</p>

<p>They grasped the letter and hustled from the room.</p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, Merry sat down and
laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d lul-lul-lul-like to know just wh-wh-where the
jug-jug-jug-joke is!” said Gamp.</p>

<p>“So would I,” confessed Hock Mason.</p>

<p>“Me, too,” grunted Browning.</p>

<p>“Let us in,” urged Carson.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll find out all about it this evening,” declared
Frank. “See if it isn’t a jolly racket. Makes
me feel same as I used to at Fardale when I put up a
job like this.”</p>

<p>“By thunder!” cried Carson. “If I ever have a boy
I’m going to send him to Fardale! It must be a great
place, to turn out chaps like Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“And Hodge,” grunted Bruce, with some sarcasm.</p>

<p>“And Merry sometimes speaks of the rackets he had
there. It must be a great school.”</p>

<p>“One of the finest in the country,” nodded Frank.
“If I have boys of my own, to Fardale they will go.
If I had a younger brother, which, unfortunately, I
have not, I’d see that he was sent to Fardale.”</p>

<p>“No wonder he’s stuck on Fardale,” said Browning.
“It was there he met Elsie Bellwood.”</p>

<p>Frank looked serious.</p>

<p>“And Inza Burrage,” said Carson.</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>Browning was regarding Merry searchingly, and
an expression of dissatisfaction settled on his strong
face.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t think you’d let anybody, not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Hodge, cut you out with Elsie, Merriwell,” he ventured
to say.</p>

<p>Frank turned on the big fellow at once.</p>

<p>“There are lots of things you do not know, Bruce,”
he spoke in a very quiet manner. “If you were joking,
why that’s all right; but I fancied you spoke earnestly,
and, if so, I don’t want you to get any false notions
that you know it all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know how things look from the road. You
think a lot of Hodge, but no man has a right to give up
a nice girl like Elsie Bellwood just because his particular
friend gets struck on her.”</p>

<p>Frank was not a little surprised to hear Browning
speak in this manner, for Bruce was the last man in
the world to meddle with the business of another, especially
in such a delicate matter as this. Such being
the case, Merry knew that Browning must feel strongly
on that particular point, else he’d never ventured to say
a word.</p>

<p>Browning was sitting up now, looking grim and
solid.</p>

<p>“He’s stuck on Elsie himself!” thought Frank, in
surprise. “That is what’s the matter! He’s a big,
strong fellow, and such men have a way of getting all
broke up over girls like Elsie. It has made him sore
to see Hodge walk off with her, same as he has since
that Doctor Lincoln affair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Aloud Merry observed:</p>

<p>“You are not in a position to correctly understand
the matter, old man. Some time you may.”</p>

<p>But Browning shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>Frank remembered that Bruce had not been in the
best of spirits of late, and now he fancied he was beginning
to understand the meaning of the change that
had come over the big fellow. At last, Browning had
realized that some great event had taken place, bringing
about a condition of affairs that astonished and
displeased him. Merriwell had withdrawn from Elsie,
and Hodge had stepped in.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in his heart, Bruce had long admired Elsie,
refraining from letting her or any one else know it
because he was Frank’s friend, and Frank seemed to
care for her. Such being the case, it must gall him
greatly to see Merry apparently give up the blue-eyed,
golden-haired girl without a struggle, letting Hodge
step in and carry her off in triumph.</p>

<p>“All right,” grunted Bruce somewhat sourly. “But
you’ve just the same as given any of us fellows an invitation
to jump in and lug off any girl you may be
bracing to.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” laughed Frank. “If you can do it,
go ahead and do it. If I can’t hold the girl, I’m sure
I don’t want her. When she willingly turns to another,
he is welcome to her.”</p>

<p>It struck Bruce that Elsie must have willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
turned from Frank to Bart, and, for the first time in
his life, he felt resentment and anger toward Elsie.
Still, he continued to be angry with Frank for giving
her up.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe you’d done it for anybody but
Hodge,” he muttered sulkily. “I suppose you have
Inza Burrage left. Well, by thunder! you want to
look out and keep her. I’m just mad enough to lug
her off myself, if I get the chance! She seemed to
like that fresh lubber Starbright one spell, and if she
can get smashed on him there ought to be a show for
me.”</p>

<p>Frank smiled. He had not told Browning of his
engagement to Inza. It had been Inza’s fancy that
while her father was so very ill it was not best to announce
the engagement.</p>

<p>While the situation had cleared up for the four persons
most acutely interested and concerned, to those
like Browning, who knew only a part of the truth, it
looked more complicated and cloudy than ever.</p>

<p>Bruce had not intended to speak out to Frank, especially
before others, and his first remark was made in
a manner that was half a joke; but, having branched
forth, he soon became serious and earnest.</p>

<p>“By gug-gug-gorry!” exclaimed Gamp. “I gotter
go git ready for to-night. S’pose you’ll be on hand
to lead the class, won’t we, Fuf-Frank?”</p>

<p>“I may not,” said Merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why? How is that?” cried Carson. “We want
you.”</p>

<p>“Got to have you!” declared Mason.</p>

<p>“Can’t get along without you,” growled Browning.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank, “I think I’ll be there; but if
you should not see me, you are to lead the class,
Browning.”</p>

<p>“Me?” gasped Bruce, without regard to grammar.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; you are to do it. You can, if you
will.”</p>

<p>“But the idea! I’ve never done anything like
that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Since you were ‘King of the Sophomores.’ My
dear fellow, you were a leader in those days, and you
can be now, if you will be. I know you have become
lazy as a dog, but you have to wake up when you
play ball, and it will do you good if you have to lead
the class to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but say!” protested Bruce, “what kind of an
Omega Lambda Chi celebration will this be without
Merriwell to take the lead?”</p>

<p>“Rotten!” exploded Carson.</p>

<p>“Bub-bub-bum!” stuttered Gamp.</p>

<p>“Sloppy!” exclaimed Mason.</p>

<p>“The whole class will be sore if you don’t show
up,” asserted Bruce. “I know you have some kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of a wild scheme in your head, but you must be on
hand to lead the class.”</p>

<p>“I may be,” repeated Frank again. “But you must
go right ahead if I am not.” He put his hand on
Browning’s shoulder. “I ask this of you as a favor. I
know the men will fall in and follow your lead.”</p>

<p>“All right,” muttered Bruce. “But I may be taken
sick between now and then. You’d better be on hand.”</p>

<p>“I have told you I expect to be there. That must
be satisfactory. Just do the right thing if you do not
find me on hand. That’s all.”</p>

<p>They went out and left Merry, who closed and
locked the door behind them. And thus hidden safely
in his room, Frank went to his trunk, from which he
took a certain square box. With the aid of the contents
of that box, he proceeded to work a most remarkable
transformation.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">CAUGHT IN THE TRAP.</span></h2>


<p>The messenger-boy was found and instructed. He
set off to find Boltwood, accompanied and directed by
Carker. Within the closed hack, behind the drawn
curtains, Ready and Bingham waited.</p>

<p>“Oh, luddy me!” chuckled Jack. “How surprised
our poetical friend will be!”</p>

<p>“What if he does not take the bait?” muttered Bingham.</p>

<p>“He will, my gentle fairy, he will.”</p>

<p>“Why are you so confident?”</p>

<p>“He is a writer of alleged poetry, and so he’s an easy
mark. See if I’m not right. And he thinks all the
girls are liable to lose their senses over him. This,
however, my sylphlike friend, is going to seem a
great conquest to him. He will rush to the arms of
Lotta. Oh, yum, yum!”</p>

<p>“If Carker does his part&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cark will find a way, Bing, old baby. He’ll be
ready to give Boltwood a gentle push at the right moment,
mark my word. Cark is an odd fish, but he’s
great at carrying out instructions. Get him to going,
and nothing but the Grim Reaper can stop him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Queer you should take up with such a fellow,
Ready.”</p>

<p>“Is it? I dunno. Contrast, you know. My dazzling
wit has the greater glitter in contrast to his prosaic
and peachy ways. I am a good thing, Bing, and I
like to set myself off as well as possible. He’s an excellent
foil, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’re a conceited ass!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully, Bing, old boy. You have a dainty
and delicate way of expressing yourself that I much
admire&mdash;I don’t think!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’re always shooting off your chin at
other people, and it does you good to tell you the
sober truth once in a while. You are an ass, Ready,
and everybody knows it; and you have got a larger
stock of conceit than any other man living.”</p>

<p>“Perchance if you continue this style of comment, I
may become angry in time.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Get mad if you want to. What’ll
you do?”</p>

<p>“I may give you an awfully cutting look.”</p>

<p>“That would be a terrible thing!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned Ready, applying his eye to a tiny
hole in the curtain. “Methinks it is about time for
Boltwood to be rushing to the arms of his Tottie.”</p>

<p>“See anything of him?” asked Bingham.</p>

<p>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“He may not come.”</p>

<p>“I think he will.”</p>

<p>“But I believe Merriwell was up to something.”</p>

<p>“He’s a dandy!” commented Jack; “but I caught
him once when he was not up to snuff.”</p>

<p>“He may have planned to get even with you.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has warned Boltwood.”</p>

<p>“Why should he do that?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have the messenger to pay and the cabman,
besides sitting cooped up here like a couple of
chumps. To-night the whole college may be ready to
give us the ha-ha.”</p>

<p>Jack shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“The game is too simple for Merriwell to play,” he
declared.</p>

<p>“Why too simple?”</p>

<p>“He would not go into anything of the sort. If he
were trying to even up the old score, he’d be at something
on a scale that would make it more even. You
have not hit it, Bingham. Besides, I think Merry is
willing to let the past remain buried. I confess that
he has had fun with me more than once, but I settled
his case the night he joined the gang that was hazing
me.”</p>

<p>“That’s where your conceit comes in,” said Bingham.
“You have an idea that you’re as clever as
Frank Merriwell. That’s enough to make anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sick! Why, he can tell you the trick he’s going to
work, and then fool you.”</p>

<p>“Then, indeed, I must be a chump in your eyes!”
sighed Ready. “Bing, you are knocking at me because
of what I said about that old gal you had out
to sup last night. All right! I’ll pay you back; see
if I don’t!”</p>

<p>“If you continue to be too fresh, I may take a notion
to thump you a little.”</p>

<p>“If you do, old guy, I shall feel it my duty to give
you the finest thrashing you ever had, even though
you weigh a pound and a quarter more than I do. I
shall&mdash;&mdash;’Sh! I see something!”</p>

<p>Jack was peering through the tiny hole in the curtain.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Bingham.</p>

<p>“He comes!” palpitated Ready.</p>

<p>“Boltwood?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!”</p>

<p>“No mistake?”</p>

<p>“Nary! Get ready to grab, Bing, you darling old
knocker! We’ll be having a lively time with him in a
minute. The messenger is pointing out the cab. Ha!
Boltwood gives the boy a quarter! Well, that youngster
has made a good thing out of the job. He
approaches! He has thrust out his chest, and is
walking hastily in this direction. Here is where we
get into gear and have fun with the gentle poet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>It was true that Rolf Boltwood was approaching the
cab. He was a rather good-looking fellow, although
he had a peculiar, melancholy cast of countenance and
long hair that flowed upon the collar of his coat. Although
not an athlete, he <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'had a very atractive'">had a very attractive</ins> figure,
and it was possible he could have been athletic had
he tried.</p>

<p>In the freshman class Boltwood had attracted very
little attention until he wrote a parody on something
or other, in which he satirized with considerable ability
a number of the prominent sophomores, including,
of course, Ready and Carker. This had brought him
into notice, but it had made any amount of enemies
for him among the sophomores. He was, indeed, a
callow youth, who regarded himself as a genuine
“lady-killer,” and it had not been difficult, for that
reason, to lure him into a trap of this sort.</p>

<p>Straight up to the cab Boltwood rushed, flinging
open the door and lifting his hat at the same time.</p>

<p>Two hands came out and clutched him by the collar
before he could start back in astonishment. Behind
him Greg Carker bobbed up from somewhere and gave
him a boosting push. The two hands in his collar
gave a surge at the same time, and into the cab went
Boltwood with a rush.</p>

<p>Slam! went the door, and up to the seat beside
the driver vaulted Carker, saying:</p>

<p>“Let ’er go! We’re off!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Strange sounds came from within the cab.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind any slight agitation,” said Carker to
the driver. “If it happens that any damage is done,
I’ll guarantee that we’ll pay double what repairs will
cost.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. Which way, sir?”</p>

<p>“Straight over the Barnesville Bridge.”</p>

<p>Away went the cab with a rattle, a rush, and cracking
of the whip.</p>

<p>Boltwood had been flung fairly across the knees of
Jack Ready, who cheerily cried:</p>

<p>“Come to the arms of your own Tottie Coughdrop,
you dear, sweet thing!”</p>

<p>Then the door slammed.</p>

<p>“What the&mdash;&mdash;” gasped the freshman.</p>

<p>“Tush, tush!” said Jack. “Why, how dare you, sir!
Such unbecoming language in the presence of your own
Tottie!”</p>

<p>Boltwood began to kick.</p>

<p>“Leggo!” he yelled. “What kind of a job is this?”</p>

<p>“Gently, gently!” warned Ready. “You may smash
the window, and, perchance, it will cost you a doubloon,
whatever that is.”</p>

<p>“Leggo!” yelled Boltwood again, still kicking.</p>

<p>“Bing,” said Jack, “if he continues to slosh round
like this, you’ll have to spank him soundly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll enjoy doing so,” assured Bingham.</p>

<p>Then he gave the freshman a crack with his open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
hand that brought a yell of pain from the surprised
fellow.</p>

<p>“Now will you be good?” asked Jack kindly.</p>

<p>Boltwood stopped kicking.</p>

<p>“Are you crazy?” he asked. “What are you trying
to do, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Is it thus that you speak of your own dear Lotta?”
sighed Jack.</p>

<p>“Lotta be hanged!” snarled the disgusted chap.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness sakes!” gasped Ready. “How pained
she is to hear you say that! Does oo ’ike oor ’Otta,
pitty boy? Ain’t oo dlad oo tum to see oor dirl, pessus
pet?”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” howled Boltwood. “Let me sit up like a
man.”</p>

<p>“Can you do it? It’s wonderful what some animals
can learn by example.”</p>

<p>Boltwood kicked again.</p>

<p>“Bing, apply the palm-oil,” directed Jack, and the
big sophomore again spanked the floundering freshman.</p>

<p>“Ow!” whooped the victim. “Hit me with a ham,
but don’t hit me with that thing, please!”</p>

<p>“This is simply the tootsie-wootsie of my friend,”
said Jack. “He is caressing you, my pretty boy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy that kind of a caress!” growled Boltwood.</p>

<p>“But you must enjoy resting in the arms of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
own Lotta,” urged Jack. “I shall be mortally offended
if you say you do not think it just perfectly heavenly.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m a fool?” snapped the captive.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ready, “you write poetry, and we have
to judge a man by his conduct.”</p>

<p>“Then I’d take you for a monkey!” flung back
Boltwood.</p>

<p>“Bing,” said Jack, “give him another application of
palm-oil.”</p>

<p>Bingham faithfully followed instructions. The
freshman tried to kick out the door.</p>

<p>“My, my!” said Ready, holding onto him with some
difficulty. “What a naughty little boy he is!”</p>

<p>“If I keep this up, I’ll have blisters on my hand,”
said Bingham.</p>

<p>“He is resting easier now,” said Jack. “I fancy your
application has done him good, Doctor Bing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get even with you fellows!” vowed the
freshman. “See if I don’t!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” growled the big sophomore.
“Your word will be no good against ours, and we do
not remember having seen you this day.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?” asked the
freshman, with greater meekness.</p>

<p>“Why, you are enjoying a date with your own
Lotta, who has fallen into lots of mazuma through the
death of her Aunt Kit,” said Ready. “How gladly
you rushed with fluttering heart to meet her! Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
poetic soul swelled with rapture, didn’t it, Rolfie? But
you jumped into this cab in such a rude, rude manner!
It was perfectly shocking. I don’t think you are
a real gent. You should have stood outside, and
smiled sweetly on your Lotta, instead of diving headlong
at her, and trying to butt her in the solar-plexus
with your wooden <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput</i>. In the high society where
she was a gay butterfly before seeking a career on the
stoige, the young gents did not behave thusly. Oh, nit,
nit! They were perfect gents&mdash;they were!”</p>

<p>“You make me sick!” gurgled Boltwood.</p>

<p>“How rude!” sobbed Jack. “Bing, do you fancy
another application of the palm will teach him better
manners?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” grunted Bingham, who was ready
enough to make the application.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, don’t!” cried Boltwood, almost in tears.
“I’ll never get over this!”</p>

<p>Truly it was humiliating for him, a poet, to be
treated in such a rude and unfeeling manner.</p>

<p>“Then you are ready to take back what you just
said?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>“And you really do love your Lotta?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” sobbed Boltwood.</p>

<p>“But you really do?” insisted Jack.</p>

<p>“What business is that to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bing, apply the palm!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” screamed Boltwood. “What do you
want me to say?”</p>

<p>“Do you really love your Lotta?”</p>

<p>“I adore her!”</p>

<p>“How nice! Will you be a good boy if you are
permitted to sit up like a man?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You won’t kick and make a muss?”</p>

<p>“Well, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bing, perhaps another application&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t kick!” gasped the freshman, in a
hurry.</p>

<p>“You will go along with us quietly?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Promise.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is very good. Do you love your Lotta?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“With all your heart?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How nice! Of course, you won’t ever tell a
soul about this ride with her, will you, precious boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t likely to!”</p>

<p>“But you must promise, precious one.”</p>

<p>“What the dickens do you take me for?”</p>

<p>“Bing, I fear you will be forced to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! I’ll promise that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will never tell a soul about it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not even the faculty?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s lovely of you. And do you love your
Lotta?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;I love her!”</p>

<p>“Away down to the bottom of your throbbing
heart?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How nice! And you’ll never make any fuss about
it if she keeps you out real late this evening?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Promise.”</p>

<p>“If I must&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You must.”</p>

<p>“All right. I promise.”</p>

<p>“That’s real sweet of you. Now you may sit up
like a man.”</p>

<p>Then Boltwood, glaring and enraged, was permitted
to sit on the seat opposite Jack, who smiled on him
sweetly.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">OMEGA LAMBDA CHI.</span></h2>


<p>Behold a transformation scene.</p>

<p>At half-past six P. M. the campus was quiet and
deserted, as it usually is at that hour. Streaks of
yellow sunlight streamed in from over the low buildings
of the quadrangle, making lighted blotches on the
ground beneath the canopy of the great elms, and not
even the twang of a banjo was to be heard.</p>

<p>The students were all at their eating-clubs and
boarding-houses.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the fence running from Alumni
Hall to the space in front of Battell Chapel and curving
away to the south was the meeting-place of streams of
students coming from all directions. The first to arrive
perched on the fence, and the later comers leaned
against the knees of those on the fence. It did not
take much more than ten minutes for them to assemble.</p>

<p>Then the singing began.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Chi-Rho! Omega Lambda Chi!</p>
<p class="verse0">We meet to-night</p>
<p class="verse4">To celebrate</p>
<p class="verse0">The Omega Lambda Chi!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The tune was supposed to be that of “Sailing, Sailing,
Over the Deep Blue Sea,” but some of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sang it to any old tune. They were not particular as
long as they could whoop ’er up to the full capacity
of their voices.</p>

<p>Somehow it had been noised around among the
freshmen that the sophs had already made a move
and got the start on them by spiriting away their
leader; but when they looked around to confirm the
truth of this, or detect its falsity, there was Dade Morgan,
with his particular friends about him, and big
Starbright, surrounded by his set, both ready for anything
that might happen.</p>

<p>“It’s a bluff!” declared the freshmen. “But it’s a
mighty poor one.”</p>

<p>And Boltwood was not missed at all, which must
have given Ready a feeling of chagrin and perplexity,
had he known it.</p>

<p>Usually the beginning of the singing was the signal
for the seniors to fall into line and start the ball to
rolling, but to-night there seemed to be delay, while
the singing continued, growing louder and louder.
There was hurrying and skurrying among the seniors.
Their leader was not on hand.</p>

<p>“Where is Merriwell?” was the question.</p>

<p>They sent to Frank’s room, but the messenger came
back with the information that he was not there. Then
it was found that he had not been at his eating-club,
and no one remembered having seen him for an hour
or more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s done it!” growled Browning, who was as mystified
as anybody. “But I’d give a peanut to know
what it is that he’s done.”</p>

<p>Bruce hesitated about taking the lead, for he was
not sure the seniors would follow him, and the singing
continued.</p>

<p>“Where the deuce is Frank?” asked Bart Hodge,
getting hold of Bruce.</p>

<p>“I’ll never tell,” grunted the big fellow.</p>

<p>“He ought to be on hand.”</p>

<p>“Said he might not.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t make known.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Got to call the men out. Come on.”</p>

<p>Then Hodge and Browning cried for the seniors to
“fall in,” and the singing lulled a little. There was a
moment of hesitation, for the class that had followed
Frank Merriwell never cared to accept any other
leader.</p>

<p>“Fall in!” thundered Browning, in his most commanding
manner.</p>

<p>“Fall in!” cried Hodge, in a clear, distinct tone.</p>

<p>The hesitation was over, and a scramble from the
senior fence took place at once, the men running to get
into line behind the two leaders. They formed in rows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of eight, with arms across each other’s shoulders, and
were ready in a remarkably short space of time.</p>

<p>“Forward!” roared Browning.</p>

<p>Then, still singing, they started down the campus,
dancing with a running step, three steps to the right
and three to the left, in time with the song. Every
third step ended with a skirt-dancer’s kick into space.</p>

<p>The lines had fallen in so swiftly that more than
two hundred men were in motion behind Browning
and Hodge, shouting the words of the song. It was a
queer sight to see that great mass of men dance forward
with three running steps to the right and end
with a kick of the right foot, followed by the same
action to the left, all the while singing as loudly as
they could.</p>

<p>The seniors were not fairly in motion when Hock
Mason, with two others, were marshaling the juniors.
When the time came, the juniors fell in behind the
seniors and followed them with the same skipping,
dancing step, singing the same song in the same shrieking
manner.</p>

<p>Bingham and Ready brought out the sophomores,
three hundred and fifty strong, and they promptly followed
the juniors.</p>

<p>None there were that night so eager to get into the
sport as the gay young freshmen. They responded to
the calls of Starbright and Morgan with alacrity.</p>

<p>But what’s this? Can it be possible? Is that fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with the long hair Rolf Boltwood? Had Ready
observed the man, he would have had a fit. Boltwood,
where in the world did you come from? Didn’t Ready,
Bingham, and Carker thrust you into a strong room in
the basement of an old storage-warehouse, and leave
you there locked fast in a room that had held many a
prisoner securely before? Did they not inform you
that you might pound on the doors and yell as loudly
as you liked, for there would be a man outside to
keep everybody away from the place, and you would
not be heard? When they were gone, didn’t you try
the door, and find it solid as granite? Didn’t you examine
the walls, and quickly decide that your prison
might hold you till you died of starvation, unless you
were released by those who placed you in it, or by their
orders? And didn’t you sit down on an old box and
despairingly bury your face in your hands?</p>

<p>Such being the case, Boltwood, how does it happen
that you are here, whispering to Starbright, who
nods and laughs, saying something to Morgan, who
seems delighted, making yourself generally useful by
aiding in mustering the men into line? Boltwood,
your escape from that old warehouse is a mystery!
How did you do the trick? Are you too busy to tell
us now? Then we’ll have to wait a while before we
find out.</p>

<p>Both Starbright and Morgan gave out a word that
was passed along from man to man. Boltwood was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to be obeyed implicitly in every order. He was to be
followed in any move he might make.</p>

<p>And thus, in some mysterious manner, Boltwood became
a leader at short notice.</p>

<p>But he did not form in line with Starbright and
Morgan at the head of the line. Instead of that, he
plunged into the very middle of the freshmen, and got
into line there, where, for a long time, he was hidden
from view.</p>

<p>The freshmen began to move, singing as loudly as
the others, but showing they were not familiar with the
dancing-step. However, they made a brave showing,
and they were happy, for every man had been tipped
off that this night they would “Lambda Chi” the sophomores,
who were entirely unprepared for what was to
happen.</p>

<p>But what was to happen? No one seemed to know,
unless, perhaps, it might be Starbright and Morgan
and this queer man Boltwood, who had suddenly developed
into a leader, not a little to the wonderment
of the men he was leading.</p>

<p>For Boltwood, hidden in the middle of the mass, was
in command of the rear half of the freshmen, and
every man back there knew it. Some of them objected,
but others silenced them by saying that Starbright
and Morgan knew what they were about, “so
shut up your heads and keep on singing.” An order
it would have been rather difficult to obey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Having carried the roaring line the length of the
campus, Browning piloted it back to the fence, from
which it started out again.</p>

<p>In front of Alumni the seniors halted, the first line
of dancing juniors bumping into them before stopping.</p>

<p>“Ready!” roared Browning, who had found a baseball-bat
somewhere, which he now flourished in the
air as if it had been a mere feather. Having taken
command, he was a leader in every sense of the word,
full of action, energy, and power, utterly unconscious
of himself. “Three times three for Alumni!”</p>

<p>Then came the barking cheer that echoed back from
the walls of the quadrangle, Browning timing it with
the jerky motions of his bat:</p>

<p>“’Rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah!
’rah! Alumni!”</p>

<p>“Forward!” roared Bruce, with a sweeping wave
of the bat.</p>

<p>All the seniors were off again with the same step,
singing the same song.</p>

<p>Mason gave the word for the juniors, and they
cheered Alumni in the same manner as had the seniors.</p>

<p>The sophomores came up and followed suit, and the
happy freshmen barked like a pack of young hyenas.</p>

<p>Well, say, freshmen! this is sport, isn’t it? This is
something you’ll not soon forget. Here is where you
have a chance to vent your kittenish feelings to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
full extent. Whoop her up, freshmen, but look out
for the finish. The sophs are laying for you, and
Jack Ready regards himself as remarkably clever in
the way of fooling freshmen. If you get ahead of him
to-night, you may congratulate yourselves.</p>

<p>The seniors had saluted Dwight Hall and danced on.
The juniors took their turn at cheering there, and so
they continued on their way from the Treasury to
the Old Library, singing and cheering and growing
hoarser and hoarser as they progressed. In front of
the statue of President Wolsey they nearly roared
their heads off. They howled at the Chittenden Library
in joyous abandon, and finally they packed into
the court of Vanderbilt, where, between the close
space of the walls, the cheering sounded like the thunder
of thousands.</p>

<p>Then, having cheered for Vanderbilt, they bethought
themselves of one who roomed there, but was mysteriously
absent from their ranks.</p>

<p>“Three times three for Merriwell!” roared
Browning.</p>

<p>Then, to the jerking of his bat, they simply roared:</p>

<p>“’Rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah! ’rah!
’rah! Merriwell! Merriwell! Merriwell!”</p>

<p>By the time the head of the line came back to Durfee
again, the song had turned to a hoarse shriek.
Then Browning and Hodge led down the three-flag-wide
stone walk that runs the length of the campus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>And the freshmen followed on, singing joyously.</p>

<p>When Lyceum and South Middle was reached the
seniors turned and led the way through the narrow
passage between the two buildings, which is known
at Yale as the Pass of Thermopylæ. The juniors followed
the seniors, and the sophomores came close
after.</p>

<p>As is the custom, the sophomores broke ranks at the
farther end of the pass, and prepared to fall on the
freshmen as they came through.</p>

<p>The head of the freshmen line came on gaily, but
the sophomores could not see what the latter half of
the line was doing.</p>

<p>“At ’em!” yelled Ready, as he saw the freshmen
halt, as if in alarm at the sight of the massed lines
waiting for them to run the gantlet.</p>

<p>The freshmen seemed to waver and crowd back,
which filled Ready’s heart with fear that they would
somehow turn about and escape. Crying for the others
to come on, he plunged into the pass. The sophs were
eager to have part in the fun, and they followed, choking
the exit to the pass and trying to jam in.</p>

<p>Then round Lyceum on the dead run charged in a
compact body the second rear half of the freshmen,
led by Rolf <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Boltwod, whose long'">Boltwood, whose long</ins> hair seemed to wave
wildly in the breeze. Without a sound, like the rush
of a mighty wave, they came upon the sophomores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
packed and struggling at the exit of the pass, sweeping
them back into it.</p>

<p>And thus the sophomores were caught between two
fires. Neither seniors nor juniors had been given a
hint of what was going to happen, and so they were
quite unprepared for this astonishing move on the part
of the freshmen.</p>

<p>There were shrieks of alarm from the sophomores,
but too late they realized that they had been caught in
a trap. They were driven into the pass, hurled down,
piled up, stood on end, and battered in the most heartless
manner.</p>

<p>But what was worse than anything else was the fact
that preparations had been made to drench the freshmen
who should be caught in this manner, and now
the sophomores’ own allies threw open windows above
and hurled down bucketful after bucketful of wet, wet
water onto the heads of the poor wretches beneath.</p>

<p>What shrieks went up! What frantic struggles
were made! What fury filled the hearts of the tricked
and outwitted sophomores!</p>

<p>And the seniors and juniors, themselves delighted by
the cleverness of the freshmen, helped rush the sophomores
into the pass by crowding upon them as if eager
to see the fun, giving no chance to break through and
escape.</p>

<p>The slaughter was something terrible to behold. The
freshmen were merciless. Starbright, the blond giant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
led them on, with Morgan, equally fierce, taking active
part.</p>

<p>But the new leader among the freshmen was the
marvel of that night. Rolf Boltwood, the poet, his
long hair flying about his head, was a perfect cyclone.
No one could stand before him. He hurled men right
and left as if they were mere children. He piled them
up in heaps of four or five, laughing as he did so. He
swept them aside as if possessing the arms of a
Samson.</p>

<p>They were astounded, for till now no man had ever
fancied Boltwood possessed such strength. Some had
imagined that he was too timid to do anything but
run away on an occasion like this. His own class had
not trusted him, and now the sight of him mowing
the enemy down in such an irresistible manner set them
wild with joy, and made them a hundred times more
fierce.</p>

<p>For once in his life, Jack Ready was bewildered. He
could not tell just what had happened.</p>

<p>“For the love of goodness!” he gasped. “My, my,
my! Where are we at?”</p>

<p>“We’re trapped, you thundering fool!” roared Bingham.
“The freshies have played it on us!”</p>

<p>“Oh, lud! oh, lud!” murmured Ready. Then he
shouted: “Charge, fellows! Rip a hole through ’em!
Come on!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Slosh!&mdash;down came a bucket of water on his head,
making him gasp.</p>

<p>“This will be the death of me!” he groaned.</p>

<p>“It ought to be!” roared Bingham. “You did a nice
thing <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'carrying Boltwod off'">carrying Boltwood off</ins>, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“You helped.”</p>

<p>“Well, what good did it do?”</p>

<p>“Merriwell fooled us! Boltwood never could lead in
anything like this.”</p>

<p>Then again Jack tried to rally the sophomores and
fight his way through. He had turned back now,
fancying it might be easier to escape into the mass of
juniors and seniors than to get out the other way. In
some manner he struggled along, trying to dodge the
descending cloudbursts of water. In the midst of his
struggles he came face to face with&mdash;Boltwood!</p>

<p>Ready nearly fainted.</p>

<p>“Good lud!” he palpitated.</p>

<p>“Good eve,” said Boltwood.</p>

<p>Then he hit Ready with a stuffed club he had captured
from a sophomore.</p>

<p>“Wow!” howled Jack.</p>

<p>“Yoop!” laughed Boltwood.</p>

<p>“You long-haired varlet!” snarled Ready.</p>

<p>Biff&mdash;the club sent Jack up against the wall.</p>

<p>“You should be more choice in your language, sir,”
said the poet pleasantly. “How are you enjoying the
fun?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, having made this inquiry, he biffed Ready
again. Jack tried to catch hold of the club, but failed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m having a perfectly elegant time!” he
panted. “But how the dickens did you get here?”</p>

<p>“Me?” inquired Boltwood, in surprise. “Why
shouldn’t I be here?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know you ought to be locked fast in that
old basement.”</p>

<p>“What old basement?” asked the poet innocently.</p>

<p>“You know; but I don’t know how you escaped.
Gimme that club.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! Take it!” Then Boltwood soaked Jack
again.</p>

<p>But this time Ready caught hold of the club and
tried to wrench it away. Boltwood held on, and they
tussled for possession of the weapon, while all round
them raged the battle most furiously.</p>

<p>“I’d give a quarter to know how you got out,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been in,” said Boltwood; “so save your
quarter. You’ll need it for arnica and court-plaster.”</p>

<p>“Leggo!”</p>

<p>“Nit!”</p>

<p>Then Jack made a spring and tried to grapple with
Boltwood.</p>

<p>“I’ll just toss you round a little,” he said, with confidence
in his ability to do so.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the freshman, getting Ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by the neck somehow and kicking his feet into the air.
“I shall enjoy it so much!”</p>

<p>Down came Ready on the back of his neck. Boltwood
placed a foot on his breast, struck a pose, and
began to recite poetry.</p>

<p>The shock and the surprise had deprived Jack of
his breath for a moment, but he quickly recovered and
grabbed Boltwood by the leg, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Come down here a moment! I want to see you!”</p>

<p>Boltwood came down, but he fell so that both his
knees gouged into Ready and knocked the breath out
of him again.</p>

<p>“Take a good look at me,” said the poet, “for I am
the last person you’ll see on earth. You die right
here.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing!” came faintly from Jack. “After this
death will be a keen delight!”</p>

<p>He had been forced to let go his hold on Boltwood,
but he scrambled up as the freshman rose. Then they
grappled again, but somehow Boltwood tossed Jack
into the air and let him fall upon a pile of struggling
sophomores, who were squirming and twisting and trying
to get up. A burst of mocking laughter came
from the lips of the freshman, and then a descending
cloud of water struck Jack in the face and eyes, blotting
out the triumphant poet from his view.</p>

<p>When Ready untangled himself from that squirming
mass, Boltwood had vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The slaughter went on joyously until the panting
freshmen were well satisfied. Then the juniors and
seniors tore open the blocking mass of men and opened
long lines, down which the sophomores staggered and
ran in their wild efforts to escape.</p>

<p>And the men of the two upper classes held onto their
sides and roared with laughter. In all the history of
Yale there had never been such a Lambda Chi night
as this. The tables had been turned completely on the
sophomores, and the freshmen were hilariously triumphant.</p>

<p>Jack Ready was sick at heart.</p>

<p>“Confound Merriwell!” he grumbled. “He must
have let that fellow Boltwood free in some way, and
this is the result! Oh, say! where can I find some
rat-poison? I want to take a lunch!”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE FIGHT FOR THE FENCE.</span></h2>


<p>The freshmen were overjoyed and triumphant; the
sophomores were downcast, battered, and gloomy. But
of all the battered and gloomy sophs, Jack Ready was
the “batterdest” and the gloomiest.</p>

<p>“It’s awful!” he groaned. “The fall of Jericho was
nothing beside this! Talk about the sun and moon
standing still! Great cats! This will turn the whole
universe backward and set the planets to capering
along in the wrong direction. My, my! but I’m very,
very tired!”</p>

<p>He held both hands to his head and looked sick.</p>

<p>Having escaped from the terrible pass, the sophomores
fled to the fence, where they gathered and excitedly
talked over what had happened. They were
united in their denunciation of the freshmen. They
felt that the freshmen had committed something worse
than a crime in thus breaking all precedents.</p>

<p>“It’s the work of Morgan!” declared one.</p>

<p>“No; Starbright was at the head of it,” said another.</p>

<p>“All wrong!” put in a third. “It was that infernal,
long-haired freak of a poet, Boltwood. He led the
half of the freshies that came round the Lyceum and
caught us in the trap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did he ever do, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Write doggerel.”</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t make a man a leader at anything.
How did they happen to follow him?”</p>

<p>That was a mystery. It had been one of the surprises
of the evening, and others were to follow.</p>

<p>Bingham found Ready. The big sophomore’s coat
was ripped up the back, and one sleeve had been torn
out at the shoulder. His nose was bleeding, and there
was fire in his eye.</p>

<p>“Say!” he growled.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“We’re a couple of diddling-danged fools!”</p>

<p>“Tell me something I don’t know,” urged Ready.</p>

<p>“You’re a chump!”</p>

<p>“That makes two of us.”</p>

<p>“Did we kidnap somebody?”</p>

<p>“I thought so.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is another think coming to you.”</p>

<p>“Then we must have dreamed it.”</p>

<p>Bingham wiped his nose with a blood-stained handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Where is Carker?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Here,” answered a doleful voice, and Greg appeared.
His necktie and collar had been ripped off, his
shirt was torn open at the neck, his face was scratched,
his hat was gone, and he was dripping wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Carker,” said Ready, with a rueful smile, “I believe
that earthquake must have bunted into us.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Greg fiercely; “what did you let
that blinkety-blanked, long-haired doggerel-writer escape
for?”</p>

<p>“Who did it?”</p>

<p>“You must. He was here. You locked him in, and
you said he couldn’t get away.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought so,” confessed Jack meekly. “That
dungeon cell has held many a freshmen before this,
and held them fast and safe.”</p>

<p>“This one got away, and he got me by the collar
right here&mdash;see! That’s about all I remember. He
spun me round in the air as if I was a two-pound Indian
club. It makes me dizzy to think of it.”</p>

<p>“He gave me this nose,” confessed Bingham. “I
grabbed him round the body from behind, but the
chump butted backward with his head and smashed
my nose out flat on my face. I dropped him. Then
he turned round and had fun ripping up my clothes.”</p>

<p>“I believe I ran across him, too,” sighed Jack.
“Why, the fellow must have been everywhere!”</p>

<p>“Or else there is four or five of them,” said Carker.
“He threw me down and stepped on me.”</p>

<p>“Then you know how the downtrodden poor feel.
It will be a good thing for you to work into your
next lecture.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to be funny, Ready!” said Carker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
“Sometimes I can stand it; but just now I think I
shall have to kill you if you try to be funny!”</p>

<p>“Kill him,” urged Bingham cold-bloodedly. “I’m
too tired to do it, but I shall enjoy the murder very
much.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you both that you want to
spit your spite out on me?” asked Jack. “You act as
if you think me all to blame for the trouble.”</p>

<p>“After I pushed him into the cab!” growled Carker.</p>

<p>“And after I blistered my hand spanking him into
submission!” growled Bingham.</p>

<p>“Then to have him handle me in such a manner!”</p>

<p>“I’ll never get over the disgrace!”</p>

<p>“Where is Merriwell?” asked Jack. “I believe he
let the fellow free.”</p>

<p>“Why should he do that?”</p>

<p>“Just to have fun with me. He’s trying to get
square for that time I fooled him by pretending madness.”</p>

<p>“By the looks of you, I should say he’s pretty near
even.”</p>

<p>“But now I’ve got a score to settle with Boltwood.
I was not prepared for him, else he’d never been able
to cuff me round the way he did.”</p>

<p>“Hear those freshmen singing!” muttered Bingham.
“Isn’t that enough to make a man’s blood hot?”</p>

<p>“It is, indeed!” confessed Ready. “I’ll never get
over this night if I live to be a hundred!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The freshmen could be seen massing in the distance.</p>

<p>“By the gods!” grunted Bingham; “I believe they
are going to try it!”</p>

<p>“Try what?” asked Carker.</p>

<p>“To take the fence!” said Bingham.</p>

<p>“That’s just what’s up!” palpitated Ready. “Boys,
we must get ready for them. They are drunken with
success, and they’re going to bear down on us.”</p>

<p>“Here is where we get even!” Carker almost snarled.
“My fighting-blood is up! Naturally, I am a peaceful
man, but the limit of endurance has been passed!”</p>

<p>“Amen!” said Ready. “I’m another! I shall strew
the ground with corpses! I shall wade knee-deep in
gore! I pray that I may again encounter that long-haired
freak!”</p>

<p>“Get the men ready!” ordered Bingham. “Let’s
give them a hot reception when they do come!”</p>

<p>Then the three set about getting the sophomores
ready for the expected attack.</p>

<p>“We must defend the fence to the last!” was the
cry. “Don’t give way an inch!”</p>

<p>“We won’t!” declared the rallying sophs. “Let ’em
come!”</p>

<p>“It’s to a finish!” said Ready, through his teeth. “If
they get the best of it this time, I’ll go jump off the
earth!”</p>

<p>“Here they come!” was the thrilling cry.</p>

<p>The freshmen came with a rush. They were full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
confidence and enthusiasm, and they felt able to do almost
any old thing to the sophomores.</p>

<p>“Stand firm!” roared Bingham.</p>

<p>The compact mass of onrushing freshmen looked
formidable enough, and, to tell the truth, the sophomores
were not quite prepared for them.</p>

<p>“Down with the sophs!” was the war-cry of the
freshmen. “Soak ’em! soak ’em!”</p>

<p>And in the lead came the long-haired poet, Boltwood,
running like a deer, calling for the others to
follow him.</p>

<p>Morgan and Starbright were also at the head of
the freshmen, but somehow since the affair in the pass
Boltwood had suddenly been recognized as a bold,
strategic, and skilful leader.</p>

<p>“He’s the chap I’m looking for!” cried Ready, and
he sprang out to grapple with the new leader of the
freshmen. Ready cast himself forward to make a
head-on tackle about the freshman’s hips, intending to
bring Boltwood to the ground with a jolt that would
settle him for a while.</p>

<p>Then, to the astonishment of everybody, Boltwood
leaped into the air and went clean over the head of the
crouching sophomore.</p>

<p>Then came the clashing shock of the two classes
meeting, and in the furious struggle that followed not
a few fellows were hurt more or less. The freshmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
tried to sweep the sophomores away with the vigor of
their onset, and they did hurl them back somewhat.</p>

<p>Then, rallied by the cries of their leaders, the sophs
braced and held their ground. Those in the front
ranks of both classes received a squeezing that drove
the breath from their bodies and seemed to flatten them
out like pancakes.</p>

<p>“Ow-wow!” gasped a fat soph. “I’m being squoze
to death!”</p>

<p>“Squoze!” panted the freshman against whom he
was jammed, “is no&mdash;name&mdash;for&mdash;it! I’m being
squashed!”</p>

<p>Both sides cheered and pushed and jammed. From
a distance the juniors and seniors looked on and
laughed and urged each class to keep at it.</p>

<p>This was sport, indeed, for the two upper classes.</p>

<p>The voice of Boltwood sounded clear and loud, urging
those behind him to shove the harder.</p>

<p>“Somebody hit that long-haired jake with a brick!”
cried an angry soph. “He’s made the whole thing a
fizzle to-night!”</p>

<p>“’Rah for Boltwood!” roared Dick Starbright, without
the least show of jealousy.</p>

<p>“’Rah! ’rah! ’rah!” yelled Dade Morgan.</p>

<p>That was the most singular part of it all. Those
men, so long rival leaders of the freshman class, seemed
ready and willing to surrender the leadership to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
new man, who had never before done anything to distinguish
himself.</p>

<p>But there was no time to wonder over that now.
There was little time to give it a passing thought.
Harder and harder pressed the freshmen, and the sophs
began to sway and waver. A moment later the soph
line broke, and then those on the outside began to
jump in and try to yank the freshmen out, to tear up in
this manner the compact mass of rushers.</p>

<p>But, with a twisting movement, the freshmen swept
on and bore the sophomores back from a part of the
fence. This partial victory seemed to give the attacking-party
greater vim, while it literally maddened the
sophomores.</p>

<p>“Yank ’em! yank ’em!” cried those who were working
on the edges, and they would catch the freshmen
by the arms or collars, and drag them out from the
rushing body, fling them down, sometimes hit them.
In fact, both sides were beginning to use their fists,
and the rush was degenerating into a free fight.</p>

<p>And the seniors and juniors roared with laughter,
still urging the mad combatants on. Not for years
had there been such hot times on Omega Lambda Chi
anniversary as there was to-night. If the faculty did
not interfere, the riot might result in a large collection
of beautiful black eyes on the morrow.</p>

<p>Through the thickest of the fray stalked Boltwood.
Man after man tackled him, and man after man went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
down before him. He seemed to have the power of a
Hercules, and he soon became a perfect terror for the
sophs.</p>

<p>Jack Ready had been dazed when he failed to bring
the fellow down by a tackle. It was wonderful that
Ready was not trampled under foot by the oncoming
freshmen, but he managed to straighten up, finding
himself caught in the rush and whirled along like a
feather.</p>

<p>In vain he had tried to break away; he was hurled
against his own class, and seemed to help in the work
of beating back his friends, to his unspeakable disgust.
But through all the wild times that followed, Ready’s
one thought was to find Boltwood and meet him again.</p>

<p>“I’m done for if I don’t!” he thought. “I’ll be the
guy of both classes! Oh, mama! why was I ever
born into this world of strife and worry?”</p>

<p>And when the fighting became general, Ready finally
found Boltwood. They were face to face. At the
same moment Bingham came up behind the poet.</p>

<p>Both sprang at him. Boltwood seemed to have eyes
in the back of his head, for he kicked out cleverly and
struck Bingham in the pit of the stomach, doubling the
big sophomore up instantly. Then he somehow caught
hold of Ready, twisted Jack round, grasped him by the
neck and the slack of his trousers, and lifted him with
a swinging movement clean off his feet.</p>

<p>Up into the air went Ready, struggling and kicking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
gasping with astonishment, bewildered and angry.
Having swung Jack up thus, Boltwood seized him
firmly by the belt, and held him aloft with one hand,
high above his head.</p>

<p>“See that!”</p>

<p>Freshmen and sophomores uttered the shout, and it
seemed that the fighting lulled for a moment, in order
for the astounded men to witness this remarkable feat
of strength.</p>

<p>Boltwood laughed!</p>

<p>“Why,” he cried, “I always knew the fellow was a
lightweight as far as his brains went; but now I find
him a lightweight in every way.”</p>

<p>Down came Ready, being lowered and tossed aside.
Bingham had just recovered enough to attempt to come
to the rescue of his classmate, but he was too late.
Boltwood dropped Jack, caught Bingham by the wrist,
gave him a twisting wrench and a trip, and sent him
spinning end over end.</p>

<p>As long as he lived Bingham never forgot how he
felt just then. It seemed that his arm had been
wrenched out of the socket and something had caused
the earth to whirl like a top. He came down flat on
his back and lay there, while the uproar continued,
looking at a calm, white star that he could see through
an opening in the trees.</p>

<p>“I didn’t come out here,” muttered Bingham thickly,
“to study astronomy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Boltwood soon became the terror of the sophomores,
who were afraid to stand up before him. As a consequence,
the freshmen had things their own way in a
very short time, and the sophs were driven from the
fence.</p>

<p>Then the freshmen piled onto the fence and sang
and whooped and had a glorious time. This was their
night, and Boltwood was their pride. They wondered
how it happened they had never known the fellow was
such a perfect whirlwind.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s a match for Merriwell!” some of them
declared.</p>

<p>Others, however, and there were more of them, declared
that Merriwell would handle Boltwood just as
easily as Boltwood had handled Jack Ready.</p>

<p>They patted Boltwood on the back and told him he
was “it.” They shook his hand, and wanted to hug
him, but he told them not to slobber. He seemed a
really modest fellow, who was not at all anxious to be
praised and applauded. They decided that it must be
his natural modesty that had kept him in the background
so long. And yet, had they paused to think it
over, they must have known that the poet was not
nearly as modest about some things.</p>

<p>But the freshmen were in no condition to think. All
they could do was cheer and sing and laugh and taunt
the chagrined and mortified sophomores.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">SOLVING THE MYSTERY.</span></h2>


<p>“Fellows,” growled Jack Ready, “we’ve got to retake
that fence if we do it with the aid of Gatling
guns! I am willing to shed my heart’s blood, but I
am not willing to listen to the insulting howling of
those freshies.”</p>

<p>But the sophomores were sore and discouraged.
The heart and life had been taken out of them. They
had lost confidence in Ready and Bingham. They had
lost confidence in themselves. They remembered with
terror the stalking wonder of the freshmen, the new
leader, Rolf Boltwood.</p>

<p>“That’s all right to say,” muttered one; “but we’re
no match for them as long as they have that fellow.”</p>

<p>“And that fellow should be safe under lock and key
now!” growled Bingham, rubbing his lame shoulder.</p>

<p>Jack Ready begged them to follow him. Do it then,
he urged, and they might take the freshmen by surprise.
The freshmen thought they had driven them
off for good and all. But it is not at all certain he
could have induced them to follow him had not Frank
Merriwell suddenly appeared and put in a word.</p>

<p>“You fellows will never hear the last of it if you let
the freshmen keep your fence,” he said. “You can’t do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that, and you know it. Try a rush, locked together,
and see if you can’t sweep them back. Go at them in
earnest while they are singing and whooping over
their triumph.”</p>

<p>“If we had you for a leader,” said some one. “If
you would meet that holy terror Boltwood.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a mark!” said Frank. “Anybody can
handle that chap.”</p>

<p>“My, my!” murmured Ready. “How wise you are!
Bet a cabbage you can’t handle him so easy!”</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed of you, Ready,” he said. “He’s no
athlete.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” growled Bingham; “but he’s the devil
let loose!”</p>

<p>But Frank led the sophomores into forming quietly
and quickly for a rush. When they were ready, Frank
saw that they started and got under way without any
yelling to give the freshmen warning that they were
coming.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that the first the freshmen knew
the sophomores were sweeping down on them in a
compact mass, ready to make another fierce struggle.
Starbright and Morgan cried for the freshmen to fall
in and get ready to meet the rush, but there was not
enough time to prepare properly before the rushers
were on them.</p>

<p>Somehow, Boltwood had disappeared. This had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
been noticed a short time before, and now they called
to him in vain. He was not there to give them courage
to withstand that furious rush of the sophs.</p>

<p>The sophomores plowed into the freshmen in an irresistible
surge, and they could not be checked. As
they found the freshmen melting before them, their
spirits rose and they grew fiercer and more determined.
The result was that the freshmen were swept away
like chaff, and the sophomores retook the fence with
so little trouble that they were almost bewildered.</p>

<p>“Where is Boltwood?” was the question asked on
all sides as the freshmen were put to rout.</p>

<p>“He’s sneaked!” declared somebody resentfully.
“He’s a coward, anyhow. It was only when excited
that he had any courage. The moment the excitement
was over, his courage left him and he got out of
the way.”</p>

<p>But neither Starbright nor Morgan made any such
remark. Both of them knew what had become of
Boltwood, and they held their peace.</p>

<p>Some of the freshmen were for making another attempt
to recapture the fence, but the most of them had
had enough and were well satisfied. They had defeated
the sophs in the pass and captured and held
the fence for a while, which was glory indeed, and
that seemed sufficient. So they began to disperse at
once, and to the sophomores was left the satisfaction of
holding what was their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as it was seen that the rioting was over
for the night, the students betook themselves to other
parts. The sophomores lingered the longest at their
fence, growling over what had happened. Jack Ready
found himself regarded with considerable disfavor,
many seeming to think he should have foreseen the
trick at the pass and been prepared for it.</p>

<p>“Alas!” he sighed. “I did foresee it to the extent
of capturing that devil Boltwood, but somehow he
broke forth, or fifth, from his dungeon cell, and was
right in the midst of the prayer-meeting.”</p>

<p>“But where did he go to?” growled Bingham. “He
disappeared mighty suddenly.”</p>

<p>“That was strange,” put in Carker.</p>

<p>“Strange!” exploded Ready. “Will you tell me
something that happened to-night that was not strange?
This poet works in wondrous ways his marvels to perform.
I’ll never get over it. Think of being held up
for ridicule by a wall-eyed he-goat like that! Yow!”</p>

<p>“And he slammed me round as if I never cost a
cent in my life,” said Bingham.</p>

<p>“He had the strength of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;” began Carker.</p>

<p>“An earthquake,” finished Ready.</p>

<p>“Let’s shake the earthquake for a while,” begged
Greg.</p>

<p>“We look as if it had shaken us,” muttered Bingham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a mystery about that man Boltwood,” declared
the sophomore socialist.</p>

<p>“I believe you!” grunted the big man.</p>

<p>“Where did he get those muscles?” demanded Greg.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to have you explain,” said
Ready.</p>

<p>“I’m another,” nodded Bing, rubbing his lame
shoulder.</p>

<p>“No man ever gets strength like that unless he trains
for it,” persisted Carker.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed Bingham.</p>

<p>“Well, when has this doggerel writer trained, may
I ask?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Then how comes it that he is so thundering
strong?”</p>

<p>“There is the mystery.”</p>

<p>“And it’s deep and dark,” said Ready. “If he’d
been any stronger he might have wiped us all off the
face of the earth. I’ve been up against Merriwell before
now, and it seems to me that this man was fully
the match for Merriwell. Somehow, he had the same
careless way of slamming a fellow round.”</p>

<p>“If we’d just had Merriwell in disguise to run
against him,” said Carker. “Oh, but the fur would
have filled the air!”</p>

<p>“Merriwell in disguise!” exclaimed Ready, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
starting and giving his own head a punch.
“Why didn’t I think of that before! Oh, lud!”</p>

<p>“It would have been a great trick,” said Carker;
“but it’s too late to think about it now.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell in disguise!” repeated Ready, as if in a
trance.</p>

<p>“Come out of it!” growled Bingham.</p>

<p>“Oh, lud! Oh, lud!” murmured Jack, again smiting
himself back of the ear with his clenched fist.
“What chumps we have been! If we’d just ripped off
his wig, he would have stood exposed! And I lost
the chance to do the trick! I must find a good soft
place to lie down and expire!”</p>

<p>“What the dickens are you talking about?” snapped
Carker.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know,” said Bingham.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” said Ready, “we have played right into
the hands of Merriwell. We gave him the chance to be
the principal figure in the affair to-night.”</p>

<p>“Are you daffy?” asked Carker. “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“He lured us into catching Boltwood and confining
the fellow so that he could get into this game,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>Still both Carker and Bingham were in the dark.</p>

<p>“Why, hang it all!” exploded Jack; “can’t you see
through a ladder? Boltwood wasn’t here at all!”</p>

<p>“What?” gasped Carker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” roared Bingham.</p>

<p>“Then who in blazes&mdash;&mdash;” began Greg.</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said Jack quietly.</p>

<p>“Merriwell&mdash;Boltwood?” gurgled Bingham. “You
can’t mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That Merriwell got us to kidnap Boltwood so that
he might disguise himself as that freak and take part
in the fun. He did it, while Boltwood languished in
the dark hole where we have stowed him. You both
know Merriwell’s ability to make up. He is a great
actor. He fooled everybody into thinking he was
Knight at the regatta. This Boltwood is about Merriwell’s
height, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Merciful heavens!” gasped Carker. “I believe you
are right!”</p>

<p>“I believe so, too!” admitted Bingham reluctantly.
“Now that I think of it, it seems to me that Boltwood
to-night was too well built for the poet. And it also
seems that I observed in his movements some of Merriwell’s
ways.”</p>

<p>“He did it to get even with me,” said Ready.</p>

<p>“And you must confess that he has about made the
score even,” said Carker.</p>

<p>Ready actually seemed relieved.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I wasn’t tossed round like that by
that freak of a freshman poet!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Bingham, “let’s go see if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Boltwood is still in the basement of the old storage-house.
If that was Merriwell, he must be there.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you!” cried Jack. “Come on, Carker!”</p>

<p>Away they went. They found a cab and piled into it
in a hurry, having given the driver directions.</p>

<p>“He’ll be there,” said Bingham confidently. “I
haven’t a doubt of it now.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Carker.</p>

<p>“I hope he is,” said Ready. “I feel like slamming
him round a few, just to relieve my feelings.”</p>

<p>They stopped at last near the old warehouse. Leaving
the cab to wait, they jumped out and approached
the dark and gloomy building. A watchman stopped
them.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Bill,” assured Jack. “Here’s your
pay for watching. We’ve come for the captive. Is he
safe?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” said the man, taking the money from
Jack. “You’ll find him right there.”</p>

<p>“Had to drive anybody away from the building?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul.”</p>

<p>“That settles it!” growled Bingham. “Now we
know who did the trick! Ready, Merriwell is more
than even with you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word!” muttered Jack. “I believe I
shall have to slam Boltwood round a little, just to ease
the strain on my nervous system.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>They entered the old building and descended into
the basement. It was dark down there, but they found
a candle and lighted it. Then they proceeded to a
heavy door, on which there was a padlock, and against
which was a heavy bar.</p>

<p>Jack took out a key and unlocked the padlock, while
Bingham removed the bar, Carker holding the candle.</p>

<p>Then the door was yanked open, and the light of the
candle shone into the room beyond. It showed them,
sitting on a box and calmly waiting, the well-known
figure of the long-haired freshman poet!</p>

<p>“Yah!” snarled Jack Ready, jumping in and pouncing
on Boltwood. “So you are here, are you?”</p>

<p>“Well, where in thunder did you think I’d be?”
growled the freshman sulkily. “I hope you are satisfied
with your scurvy trick!”</p>

<p>“Scurvy trick, hey?” cried Jack, growing warm.
“Be careful! Your language is offensive, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, you haven’t done anything to me that was
offensive, have you? You think you can do just as you
hanged please without anybody saying a word. But
I’ll fix you! I’ll write a poem about you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you will,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. I’ve made up my mind to that, and
I’ve been composing some of the stanzas while you’ve
kept me locked up here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have? Well, you want to get them right
out of your head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>They led the freshman forth and made their way
from the old building. As they departed, the man they
had paid for watching stood at a distance and chuckled.</p>

<p>“Well, this has been a great night’s work,” he muttered.
“Both chaps paid me a fiver. Ten dollars for
doing nothing! I’d like to make a strike like that
every night.”</p>

<p>The sophomores led Boltwood to the cab, into which
they thrust him. Then they piled in, the door slammed,
and the cab rolled away.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Ready, when they were all in the cab,
“I want you to repeat some of the poetry you have
composed about me.”</p>

<p>“You won’t like it,” said Boltwood, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect I will. But begin.”</p>

<p>“All right. It begins like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“There was a little Jack,</p>
<p class="verse2">And it came to pass</p>
<p class="verse0">That this poor little Jack</p>
<p class="verse2">Became a jackass.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Bingham snorted, and Carker made some sort of a
gurgling sound.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll repeat any more of it,” said Boltwood,
in a tone of voice that seemed to tremble with
apprehension.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you hadn’t better!” said Ready coldly.
“That is quite enough.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” muttered Carker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s not poetry,” asserted Ready.</p>

<p>“I admit,” said Boltwood, “that it contains more
truth than poetry.”</p>

<p>Then Bingham snorted again.</p>

<p>“You’re altogether too gay, my fresh young friend!”
cried Jack, getting hold of Boltwood and giving him a
shake.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think you are mistaken!” exclaimed Boltwood,
getting hold of Jack and giving him a fiercer
shake.</p>

<p>“What the deuce are you doing?” cried Ready.</p>

<p>“What the deuce are you doing?” asked Boltwood.</p>

<p>Then Jack got mad and smacked the freshman with
his open hand. But quick as a flash Boltwood came
back with his open hand, nearly knocking Jack’s head
off.</p>

<p>“Give it to him, fellows!” cried Ready angrily.
“Let’s teach the chump a lesson!”</p>

<p>“Do!” urged Boltwood, as he suddenly biffed Bingham.
“I shall enjoy it so much!”</p>

<p>That made the big fellow mad.</p>

<p>“You are a chump!” he growled.</p>

<p>But somehow Boltwood managed to yank Carker
round so that Greg received the blow Bingham intended
for Boltwood.</p>

<p>The freshman laughed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this fun!” he said. “It’s far better than being
shut up in that dark hole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, wow!” howled Carker. “That nearly knocked
my head off!”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have been any great loss,” said Boltwood.</p>

<p>By this time the three sophomores were angry in
earnest, and they proceeded to pitch into the freshman.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to spank him again, Bing,” said Ready.</p>

<p>But when they tried to yank the freshman down
and get him into position for spanking, they found it
could not be done very easily, and he managed to rap
their heads together till they saw stars and heard bells
ringing.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you having lots of fun with me?” inquired
Boltwood.</p>

<p>“Oh, lud!” groaned Ready. “My head, my head!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the freshman. “It’s hard to
crack solid wood.”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s too much!” exploded Jack.</p>

<p>“Is it?” asked Boltwood. “Then it may not be
solid; perhaps it’s hollow.”</p>

<p>“Jump on him!” urged Carker, whose “dander” was
up. “Let’s kill him!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” urged the fellow; “go ahead and
kill me. I’ll see how you do it.”</p>

<p>Ready thought he had the range of Boltwood, and
he struck out. His knuckles, however, encountered
something hard, knocking the skin off them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Too bad!” said the voice of the freshman. “Try
it again, please.”</p>

<p>“Slam him down in the bottom of the cab!” roared
Bingham.</p>

<p>“Won’t that be nice!” laughed the freshman. “You
can use me for a foot-mat. He, he!”</p>

<p>But he got hold of Bingham by the back of the
neck, and gave the big fellow a twisting flop that
threw him to the bottom of the cab.</p>

<p>“Steady,” said the poet, as he held the big soph
down with his knees. “Lie still and take things easy.”</p>

<p>Both Carker and Ready tried to grapple with the
fellow, but they got hold of each other by mistake, and
he proceeded to slam them down on top of Bingham,
filling the space between the two seats with their
bodies. Then he sat on them and held them down.</p>

<p>The cab rumbled on, and the freshman began to
sing, “Throw Him Down, McClusky.”</p>

<p>Bingham howled, Carker squawked, and Ready
squealed.</p>

<p>In this manner the cab rattled up to the corner of
College and Chapel Streets, where it stopped. The
freshman wrenched open the door, jumped out, bade
the discomfited and disgusted sophomores good night,
and ran into Osborn Hall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The events of that night completely mystified Ready,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Bingham, and Carker. They were certain that one
of the “Boltwoods” was Merriwell, but which one was
the question that troubled them. After a while Jack
Ready figured it out.</p>

<p>“They were both Merriwells!” he declared.</p>

<p>“How could that be?” asked Bingham.</p>

<p>“Merriwell somehow found out where we had taken
Boltwood. He left the fellow there, while he made
up and led the freshmen. When the fight for the fence
was over, he hastened to set Boltwood free and take
his place, again in disguise. So it was Merriwell we
encountered both times.”</p>

<p>It seemed marvelous, but it was the real explanation,
Jack felt confident. However, when they accused
Frank, Merry lifted his eyebrows, seemed greatly astonished,
and told them they must be going daffy.
Nor could they get him to admit that he had taken any
part in the rush or had been in the cab with them.</p>

<p>“But to my dying day I shall believe it was Merriwell!”
said Jack.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MAN WHO LOST THE GAME.</span></h2>


<p>The baseball season had fairly opened up.</p>

<p>Yale men were full of enthusiasm for their nine,
which easily wrested victory from the Princeton
Tigers in the first game of the series. But the confidence
of the rooters met with a severe shock, and it
was a pretty sore lot of lads that came back from
Princeton after the second game with the Tigers.
The first game had been won so easily that Yale
counted on taking two straight without much trouble,
and a great crowd of fans had accompanied the nine
to “whoop ’er up” and rejoice and have a high old
time.</p>

<p>During the game the rooters from New Haven
had done their best to make as much noise as the
great throng of Princeton admirers, and some of
the Yale crowd quite lost their voices; but, alas! all
this whooping and cheering could not save the game
when the final pinch came, and Princeton lowered
the blue to the dust.</p>

<p>During the first four innings Yale led, and it
looked like a repetition of the first game, when Yale
had never been headed from the start throughout the
game. But in the fifth inning came a change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The score was five to two. The “hot end” of
Princeton’s batting order came up, and the first man
sent a skipper past Morgan, who was playing short.
It was not an error, for Dade did not touch the ball.
Some thought he might have touched it if he had
tried hard.</p>

<p>The next batter dropped one just over the infield
and out of reach of the outfield. Then an error by
Carson at third filled the bags.</p>

<p>Then came the first great catastrophe. Starbright
was pitching. The next batter connected with one
of his curves, driving a long fly into center field.
Mason made a run for it, and it struck fairly in his
hands.</p>

<p>But he did not hold it! It dropped down somewhere,
and, while he was wildly searching for it about
his feet, four men romped in over the home plate, putting
Princeton one in the lead.</p>

<p>This was simply awful. Merriwell saw what was
liable to happen, and he started in warming up at
once. Frank had made no mistake in his anticipations.
Starbright went up in a balloon. The next two men
hit him safely, and then he gave a base on balls. The
bases were filled when Merriwell went into the box.</p>

<p>The cheering of the Tigers was meant to encourage
the home team and rattle the visitors still more. Somebody
asked what was the difference between Buffalo
Bill and Yale. Somebody else answered that Buffalo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Bill had a show and Yale hadn’t. And the crowd
laughed at this chestnut.</p>

<p>But the next batter found it impossible to connect
with Merry’s shoots. He made two fouls, and two
strikes were called on him as a penalty. Then he
fanned and missed. The ball plunked into Bart
Hodge’s mitt, and the striker ambled sadly back to
the bench. That made the second man retired.</p>

<p>The next batter put a long fly into left field, but
Gamp pulled it down and retired the side. Princeton,
however, had the lead.</p>

<p>In the next inning Yale tied the score; but in the
seventh Princeton again took the lead, making two.
The crowd roared with joy, for it seemed that Merriwell
was going to pieces. Frank, however, steadied
down after his own fashion and struck out two men,
which retired the Tigers.</p>

<p>But Princeton held the lead, and there was great
rejoicing. The Yale rooters kept up their ’rah-’rah-ing.
Neither side scored in the eighth, and the ninth
came on with the orange and black waving triumphantly.</p>

<p>Merriwell was the first batter up, and he led off
with a three-bagger. That seemed to wake the Yale
men up, and some lively hitting followed, so that the
blue tied the score, setting the rooters crazy with joy.</p>

<p>Princeton was savage, and the first man got a
pretty single off Merry. A dropped fly in the outfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
let the runner round to third and put the second
batter on second.</p>

<p>Hodge was nervous and Frank became afraid of
him, for he did not seem to hold the ball after his
usual fashion. Merry tried the double-shoot and
Bart came near having a passed ball, which must have
let in a score.</p>

<p>Then, forced to be careful, Merriwell became too
careful, which let Princeton fill the bags by getting
the batter down to first on balls.</p>

<p>Not a man was out. Yale was in a hole, and the
cheering of the Tigers rolled across the field, while
the orange and black fluttered and flaunted joyously.</p>

<p>This was the kind of a game to thrill the nerves of
the spectators and set their hearts pounding. The
great concourse of people leaned forward on the
benches and watched breathlessly for what was to follow.</p>

<p>There came a hush.</p>

<p>Whizz&mdash;crack! The ball had been hit.</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;one!” cried the umpire, as the ball went
foul.</p>

<p>“All right, Leverage,” said the captain of the
Tigers encouragingly. “You’ve got his alley. You’ll
line it out next time.”</p>

<p>Leverage was a hitter. Frank feared the fellow
might smash out a long one, and so he resorted to
the double-shoot without delay. Two balls were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
called; then another strike. But Bart was having
great difficulty with the double-shoot.</p>

<p>Merry gave Leverage a rise, but could not pull
him with it.</p>

<p>“Three balls,” decided the umpire.</p>

<p>The next ball delivered would decide the matter.</p>

<p>Frank used a drop. Leverage got under it, and hit
it a savage crack, lifting it into the air.</p>

<p>“Hold your bags!” roared a coacher, as he saw
Hock Mason getting under the ball. “Run the moment
he catches it!”</p>

<p>The coacher on third was giving the runner there
some advice, getting the man braced, ready to start
for home. Leverage had skipped down to first. The
men on first and second were ready for whatever might
happen.</p>

<p>Mason got under the ball and waited for it. It
seemed certain that he must catch it, but could he
stop the runner on third from scoring?</p>

<p>There was a hush. The ball struck fairly in the
hands of the Southerner, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bounced out! He had muffed it!</p>

<p>“Run!” shrieked the coachers, while the great
crowd of Princeton men rose up and roared.</p>

<p>The runner who had been on third came scudding
home. The man who had been on second raced
like a wild-eyed runaway colt to third, where the
coacher made furious gestures for him to keep on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
hard for home. The man on first got to second
safely, and Leverage, the batter, was comfortably on
first.</p>

<p>Mason found the ball, his heart full of rage and
dismay, picked it up and threw wildly into the diamond.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Frank got in front of it, and was able
to hold the runners on their bases, not letting them
move farther; but he could not stop the second man,
who had been sent tearing home, and Princeton was
two scores in the lead.</p>

<p>How the Tigers roared! How their colors fluttered
and waved! No wonder they were delighted.
Yale had her very best team on the field.</p>

<p>The Yale fans looked weary.</p>

<p>“That’s ten runs for Princeton,” said Chan Webb,
who, with Cowles, Mullen, and Nash, had come down
to see Lib Benson play in right field. Benson was
one of their particular set. He had once been an
enemy of Merriwell, but he soon found that he was
making himself very unpopular, and he changed his
tune. However, his friends had prophesied that he
could not make the ball-team as long as Merry was
captain. In this he had shown them they were mistaken,
for Frank had put him into right field, though
his ambition was to cover a bag.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” nodded Gil Cowles gloomily. “And
it looks as if they might make more. Nobody’s out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye gods!” sobbed Irving Nash. “It’s an awful
thing to lose this game, and that man Mason is to
blame for it all.”</p>

<p>“Right!” exclaimed Cowles. “Princeton has made
ten scores, and Mason is responsible for exactly six of
them. His first muff let in four, and this one let in
two more. He’s a bird!”</p>

<p>“He’s not to blame at all,” asserted Mullen, to the
astonishment of his companions.</p>

<p>“Why isn’t he?” they fiercely demanded, turning
on him. “Who is to blame?”</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said Mullen grimly.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p>“Merriwell put Mason on the team, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He has been told that the man was not fast
enough, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t drop him, would he?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, that fixes the responsibility. Merriwell has
shown mighty poor judgment, and that’s all there is
to it. I have nothing against Merriwell, but I have
against the association that lets him run the team just
as he likes, in defiance of anybody else. Merriwell is
a wonder as a pitcher, and he’s all right as captain of
the team; but he should not have supreme authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and I’ve said so right along. Why, some of his best
friends are against Mason.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“They say Hodge has kicked like a steer. Notice
Hodge has not been in his usual form to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I understand he tried to get Merriwell to
drop Mason off last night, but Merry wouldn’t hear
of it. That’s what ails Hodge to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, it looks bad for us now.”</p>

<p>Then they fell to watching the playing, for Frank
was in the box, ready to resume, and Princeton was
booming her cry over the field.</p>

<p>Frank settled down to business now. He had
talked with Bart. Hodge was mad. His face was
flushed and his teeth set. The shoots came over the
plate in bewildering variety, but Bart froze to them
all and held them.</p>

<p>One, two, three strikes were called on the next
batter, and down he went.</p>

<p>The next man lifted a little fly, which Merry took
himself.</p>

<p>“Merriwell is pitching now!” said the Yale spectators.
“Just watch him!”</p>

<p>The ball did not look larger than a marble when
it left Frank’s hand and went whistling over the corners
of the plate. Princeton was still cheering, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
something told every witness that the orange and black
would score no more that day.</p>

<p>One strike!</p>

<p>Two strikes!</p>

<p>Three strikes!</p>

<p>“Batter is out,” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>Then Yale cheered, and the men came trotting in
from the field.</p>

<p>Mason was a sorry-looking fellow. He hung his
head, for it seemed that every eye in that great crowd
was turned on him.</p>

<p>Of course, Frank did his best to cheer his men, but
Yale was doomed to defeat that day.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that a very gloomy and very
sore set of fellows returned to New Haven after the
game.</p>

<span class="fs70">A PROUD-SPIRITED YOUTH.</span></h2>


<p>In all Yale no man felt as bad as Hock Mason.
He was proud, and he knew he was almost universally
blamed for the loss of the game. Thinking the
matter over, he could see that he was responsible.
If he had caught both flies but one man could have
scored off each of them, at most, and that would have
left the score eight to six in Yale’s favor.</p>

<p>“I was a fool to try to play baseball!” he bitterly
thought. “I’d never have tried it if it hadn’t been for
Merriwell. He wanted me to do it.”</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that such a thought was
selfish in the extreme, and he was ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>“You’re a mighty mean chap, Mason,” he grimly
declared, to himself, “to think such a thing about a
man who has done as much for you as Merriwell!
Don’t try to lay the blame on him!”</p>

<p>No shouting crowd met the returning players at
the station and escorted them in triumph up Meadow,
Church, and Chapel Streets. No band turned out to
thrill them with its music. No shouting, cheering
students surrounded them and strove for the glory of
a hand-shake. On the campus no bonfire blazed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
flared and reddened the foliage of the elms, its light
being reflected back from the windows of the quad.</p>

<p>“There seems to have been a funeral somewhere,”
said Jack Ready. “How sad it is! La! la! Makes
me feel like weeping large, fat, briny tears. Oh, me!
oh, my! How different this time is from some other
times!”</p>

<p>“Keep your face closed!” grunted Browning.
“Every time you open it, there’s such a rush of wind
that I have to hold my cap on.”</p>

<p>“Some things are awfully sad to contemplate,” persisted
Ready, who could not be easily suppressed. “It
is said that in ’steen billion years the sun will burn
out, and we’ll all freeze to death for want of heat.
Isn’t that awful? And what would you say if I were
to tell you that all our rivers would soon dry up?”</p>

<p>“I’d sus&mdash;say,” stuttered Gamp solemnly, “gug&mdash;go
thou and dud&mdash;do likewise.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Browning shook with suppressed laughter,
for all of the feeling of disgust that had possessed
him ever since the ending of the game in Princeton.</p>

<p>Mason went straight to his room, where he spent
a most bitter night, scarcely closing his eyes in sleep.
All night long he dreamed that he was pursuing flies
that got away from him, or that ten thousand eyes
were turned on him in withering scorn and contempt,
seeming to glare at him as one great eye of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>His Southern pride had been touched to the quick.
He felt that he could not endure the sidelong contemptuous
glances of those who must look on him
with scorn for what had happened. If it had not
seemed cowardly, he would have contemplated getting
away from college somehow for a while.</p>

<p>“But I can’t play ball any more!” he told himself.
“I can’t! I can’t do it! Gamp would have caught that
fly&mdash;both of them! He always catches anything he
can get his hands on. He’s a Yankee, and everything
sticks to a Yankee’s fingers! They can hold onto
money harder than any class of people I ever saw.”</p>

<p>Mason was homesick. He did not confess it to
himself, but he longed for a sight of his South Carolina
home, with the red road winding past and running
away into the pine woods. He longed for a
sight of the negro cabins, with the old mammies smoking
by the doors and the pickaninnies romping and
playing and rolling their white eyes up to the passing
stranger. He longed for the peaceful quiet that pervaded
the air and the genial warmth of the bright
Southern sunshine. He felt that the North was cold
and heartless, and he wished himself away.</p>

<p>And so he tossed and turned till the gray light of
morning sifted in at his window and reached his bed.
In the morning light he slept dreamlessly for the first
time, and there was a smile on his face, for at last he
was at home and his misery was forgotten. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
his dreaming he seemed to hear the joyous singing of
colored laborers in the fields, and the sound was sweet
as the chime of heavenly bells.</p>

<p>It was six minutes of eight when Mason awoke.
He came out of bed with one great leap. It was his
habit to take a sponge bath in the morning, but there
was no time for anything of the sort this morning.
He flung on his underclothing, tore open his wardrobe
door, yanked out a mackintosh and a pair of rubber
boots, jumped into the boots, pulled on the mackintosh,
seized an old hat, and tore out of his room.</p>

<p>In this rig, Mason appeared at chapel in due time,
and he was not the only student present who was
dressed in a wild and weird fashion.</p>

<p>To Hock it seemed as if the eyes of all present
were on him. He did not dare look up, but felt his
face burning. His sensitive nature suffered extreme
torture until he could escape, when the service was
over, and hurry to his room.</p>

<p>Merriwell had observed Mason, and Frank fancied
he understood how the proud fellow felt.</p>

<p>It was somewhat remarkable that Hock Mason, a
man who had once been a bully, should have such a
sensitive nature; but of late Frank had been studying
the chap, and he found the Southerner a very queer
character.</p>

<p>When he came to Yale, Mason had regarded himself
as far superior to the majority of the students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
there, just as he fancied a man born in South Carolina
must naturally be superior, everything considered,
to a man born anywhere else. It had irritated him
when he found that in the democratic atmosphere
of Old Eli there was none to bow down and acknowledge
him a superior. Then he had started out knocking
into the heads of his associates the conviction
that he was “the real thing,” but this policy had not
worked very well. He became more and more disliked
until he ran against Merriwell, who gave him a
sound thrashing and took some of the growing conceit
out of him.</p>

<p>But it was Merriwell’s interest in Mason while the
latter lay ill in a hospital that completely won Hock.
Not another soul came to inquire how Mason was
getting along. Those who pretended to be his friends
remained away, but daily Frank Merriwell called, and
Frank it was who came first to the side of Hock’s cot
when a visitor was permitted to see him.</p>

<p>When Mason left the hospital he was completely
cured of his bullying inclinations. More than that,
he had become a stanch friend of Merriwell.</p>

<p>Mason never anticipated that he would be accepted
as a member of Merriwell’s “flock.” That was too
much for him to dare to hope. All the same, he
was stanch and true. He did not obtrude himself on
Merry or Merry’s friends, and he conducted himself
modestly and quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>By some it was thought that the spirit of the
Southerner had been broken, which, however, was
not the case. He had simply learned his lesson, and
learned it well. When the time came he showed that
he had quite as much spirit as of old. And he could
fight better when forced to do so, for he knew he was
fighting in a just cause.</p>

<p>But for all that Mason had once seemed to be a
bully, there was not much of the bulldog about him.
He was not a quitter, but he felt always that it was
best to get out of a thing before he was kicked out.</p>

<p>Not till he was pulled into Merriwell’s set did he
become one of the circle. Even then he was rather
quiet, although his quietness was that of pride, instead
of modesty. Sometimes this sort of retiring
pride is mistaken for modesty.</p>

<p>After chapel Hock had plenty of time to think. He
kept away from his eating-club, finding breakfast at
a lunch-cart. He knew it would do him little good to
study that day, but he tried to apply himself. As he
was leaving his room some time after breakfast, he
paused at the head of the flight of stairs. At the foot
of the flight, three men were talking.</p>

<p>“It was just a case of bad judgment on Merriwell’s
part,” said one. “Mason can’t play ball.”</p>

<p>“Everybody is kicking about it,” declared another.
“Mason must be dropped from the team.”</p>

<p>“He’d never made the nine in the first place, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
had not been one of Merriwell’s friends,” declared the
third.</p>

<p>Then they moved away together, still talking baseball.</p>

<p>Hock Mason stood quite still, his face rather pale.</p>

<p>“So that is what they’re saying!” he muttered.
“They are blaming Merriwell for taking me onto the
nine. Well, I’ll get off it at once.”</p>

<p>And he started to find Frank.</p>

<span class="fs70">FRANK SETTLES A POINT.</span></h2>


<p>“Hello, Hodge!” cheerfully called Frank, as Hodge
came into his room.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Bart shortly.</p>

<p>“Sit down. I’ll be ready to chat a bit as soon as I
finish this sentence.”</p>

<p>“Always writing,” muttered Bart, looking curiously
at Frank’s work. “Don’t you ever give yourself a
minute’s rest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Merry laughed. “You know the fellows
come round and make me hold up sometimes. But
I’m rushing this work through, and I plug away at it
when I find time.”</p>

<p>“What is it&mdash;a book?”</p>

<p>“You’ve guessed it.”</p>

<p>“Honest?” exclaimed Bart, surprised.</p>

<p>Frank nodded. Then, while Bart watched in wondering
silence, he finished the sentence.</p>

<p>“There,” he exclaimed, throwing down the pen.
“That chapter is nearly completed. One more and
I’ll have the book done.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to turn author, are you?” asked
Bart.</p>

<p>“To some extent&mdash;perhaps,” nodded Frank. “I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
thinking of giving some of my time to the work, which
I find very pleasant, even though I have been forced
to do it here in snatches and under great difficulty.
When the idea came to me, I thought of putting it
off till after leaving college, but it preyed upon me
till I was forced to sit down and begin the work.
Once begun, it has forced me to push it through to
completion. I have written many a night when other
fellows were sleeping, and I was supposed to be in bed
myself.”</p>

<p>“What is it, anyway&mdash;a novel?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then what&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll see when it is published. I think it will
contain a lot of good advice.”</p>

<p>Bart nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” he agreed. “If I had not had you
for an example, Merriwell, there’s no telling what
I’d be now. I’m certain I must have developed into
a cigarette fiend.”</p>

<p>“And cigarette fiends never can be strong until
they give up the things forever,” asserted Frank.
“Every day a fellow smokes cigarettes on this end
of life he wipes off a day on the other end. He is
cutting his life shorter day by day, though he may
not know it. It’s true, Hodge, and it makes me feel
bad for some of the foolish chaps who think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
are sporty and up to date because they smoke the
little paper-covered life-destroyers.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” agreed Bart; “but there are some
fellows who do not smoke cigarettes, and who cannot
play ball.”</p>

<p>Merry looked at his companion sharply, quickly
divining what Bart was driving at.</p>

<p>“You’re feeling bad over the loss of that game,”
he said. “Well, don’t you think I felt rather sore?
If I’d pitched the whole of it there might have
been&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The pitching did not lose that game, Frank, and
you know it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know, I know, and everybody knows, just
where the responsibility falls. Mason lost that game.
He let in six runs by dropping those two flies.”</p>

<p>“Two men must have scored, anyhow, even if he
had caught them. It would have been great work
if he had stopped either runner at the plate.”</p>

<p>“But what if they had? We’d carried off the game,
with a score of eight to six. It was the other four
scores that beat us. Three of them came in off Starbright’s
pitching. Now, you know I have never taken
much stock in Mason. Some fools have said it’s because
Mason is like me; but that’s not it at all. He
hasn’t sand, Merriwell, and it takes sand to play ball.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you are wrong, Hodge. I believe Mason
has plenty of sand.”</p>

<p>But Hodge shook his head grimly.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. Even if he has, he can’t fill that
field, and you must know it by this time. There are
plenty of better men than he who are eager to get
onto the nine.”</p>

<p>“Name a few of them.”</p>

<p>“Hershal, for one.”</p>

<p>“And would you advise me to drop Mason and take
on Hershal?” asked Frank quietly.</p>

<p>“It would be worth trying.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in experimenting at this stage of
the season?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly in experimenting,” said Bart, uneasily.
“But you have tried Mason and found him a fizzle.”</p>

<p>“Hodge, you know the condition in which I found
things when I came back to college this spring. The
prospects for a first-class ball-team did not look very
bright. The coaches were worried and disgusted.
The newspapers were saying Yale could not put a
winning team onto the field. Everybody lacked confidence.
Isn’t that right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I had to do something. I went to my
friends who had some ability to play and asked them
to come out and take hold. I asked them to get out
everybody who had any chance of making a player.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
You know how the cage was filled with new men.
Some of them were no good and did not stay long,
but the coaches were encouraged, and things began
to look up. Confidence was restored, and people began
to say Yale had a chance. The tone of the newspaper
reports changed. Things began to go better.
On the Easter trip I took along every man who was
promising. From those men I made the nine as it
now stands, and I am still confident that the team is
all right. I have every reason to be confident. Yale,
for all of prophecies to the contrary, has had a strong
team on the field and has won a great majority of
her games. I know the hard games are to come,
but the team is pulling together better every day. As
long as the men have confidence in each other and
all work hard to win everything will go right. The
moment they begin to pull apart things will begin to
go wrong. Jealousy, petty hatred, small spite, and
such feelings ruin many ball-teams.”</p>

<p>Bart flushed.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re not firing shots at me!” he exclaimed.
“I’m sure I’m not envious of Mason; but I will confess
that I have lost my confidence in the fellow.
You know as well as I do that he is a conceited, self-satisfied
prig. He thinks himself much better than
common folks.”</p>

<p>“And do you reckon yourself as common?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not common&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;well, you know what I
mean. He always was that way. He can’t get over
the idea that the son of a South Carolina landowner,
a chap whose father has never done work, is better
than the son of a Northern farmer, who has bent his
back to the plow. That kind of a feeling makes him
hold his nose high, and it makes me sick! I’ve never
had to work; my father had money, and he never
performed manual labor; but I know fellows here
who are working their way through college who are
just as good as I am&mdash;some of them may be a blamed
sight better. Mason, if his father were to fail to-morrow,
would have to quit his college course. He
couldn’t get through just because he couldn’t bring
himself to honest work. Think he’d go up in the
White Mountains and be a waiter at a summer hotel?
Not much! He tries to hide it, but I know he feels
contempt for fellows who are compelled to do such
work. And the real truth is that such fellows are a
hanged sight better men than Mason or any of his
ilk! There&mdash;now you know what I think of Hock
Mason.”</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>“Bart,” he said, “I knew you were prejudiced
against Mason, although you have never spoken thus
plainly before. It is because you do not understand
the fellow. His rearing has been different from that
of Northern men. He cannot at once accept a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
point of view. He has been raised where day labor
was looked on as suited to the black man and to
poor white trash. The colored men and the low whites
have degraded labor in that way. In the North colored
laborers and illiterate whites do not carry the
great burden of work. Some of our millionaires have
been poor boys who have had to work hard at any
old thing, and thus we look at work from another
view-point. But we must not be too hard on Mason
and fellows like him from the South. Above all
things, Hodge, you must not let personal likes and
dislikes influence you in baseball. No matter how
much you dislike a man, if he can play ball, you must
go in with him and work for the good of the nine.”</p>

<p>Bart was fidgeting.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said; “but Mason can’t play.
He proved it yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen him put up such a game before?”</p>

<p>“No; but he’s green.”</p>

<p>“And he has come forward faster than any green
man I have ever tried. He has worked like a dog to
make himself valuable. Not another man on the nine
has worked so hard. He could catch a ball when he
began, and that was about all he could do. He could
not throw, but in one week’s time he became a good
thrower. In three weeks he was good enough for
the field. He could not bat, but he practised faithfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and every day he made progress. He is now
one of the safest hitters on the team.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t depend on him in an emergency, and
you know it, Frank.”</p>

<p>“There were plenty of men who used to say the
same thing about you. They don’t say so now.”</p>

<p>Bart shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“They are saying everything you can imagine about
Mason.”</p>

<p>Frank looked grim.</p>

<p>“Because Mason had a bad day and put up a poor
game. Every player has such days, no matter how
good he may be.”</p>

<p>“And you mean to keep him for all of what everybody
says?”</p>

<p>“I mean to give him another trial.”</p>

<p>Just then there was a knock, and Mason stood outside
the door. He came in at Merry’s invitation, looking
blue as a whetstone. Without glancing at Hodge,
he began:</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell, sah, I judge you’ve made a mighty
big mistake in me. You thought I could play ball,
but by this time, sah, you must be pretty well satisfied
that I’m a first-class flub. I have come, sah, to
give notice that I do not propose to make a jackass of
myself any more. I am done, sah. As long as I live
and have my right mind I’ll play no more baseball.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>A feeling of satisfaction seized upon Hodge, who
thought:</p>

<p>“The fellow has more sense than I imagined.”</p>

<p>Frank looked at Mason calmly and steadily, something
like deep indignation showing in his face.</p>

<p>“And is this the way you propose to treat me?”
he sternly demanded. “I did think, Mason, that you
were my friend.”</p>

<p>Hock gasped.</p>

<p>“I am, sah!” he cried quickly. “That’s why I’m
taking myself off the nine. You don’t know what
they’re saying, Mr. Merriwell. They say you took
me on because you regarded me as a friend, and that
it was a mighty bad piece of judgment on your part,
sah. They say I must get off or ruin the team.”</p>

<p>“And you propose to leave me in the lurch just because
some fellows have been making that kind of
talk! I didn’t think it of you, Mason&mdash;I swear I
didn’t!”</p>

<p>Hock looked distressed.</p>

<p>“I’m only doing what I think is the right thing,
sah,” he protested. “If you knew what a miserable
night I spent last night, Merriwell! I’d a heap rather
been shot than to have lost that game. And I know
I was the one who lost it! I should have held both
of those flies. They were right in my hands.”</p>

<p>“Have I ever said anything to you because you
failed to hold them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sah.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was because I knew you felt bad enough
about it. Had you been some one else on the team,
I might have said something. Until that time you
remain on the nine. You will report for practise to-morrow.
There is no practise to-day.”</p>

<p>Mason’s breath was taken away by Frank’s masterful
manner. He had come there firmly resolved
to take himself off the team, no matter what Merriwell
might say.</p>

<p>“But you&mdash;you don’t want me out there in center
field,” he weakly said. “There are others&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll report for practise to-morrow, Mason,”
Frank again said, escorting Hock to the door. “And
you’ll play in that field until I put you elsewhere.
That matter is settled.”</p>

<p>When Mason was gone Frank turned and found
Hodge looking black as a thunder-cloud.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">MERRIWELL’S POWER.</span></h2>


<p>So it happened that Hock Mason appeared on the
field for practise the following day. His appearance
was generally unexpected. It was thought that, having
discovered the universal sentiment, Merriwell
could not help dropping the South Carolinian from
the team.</p>

<p>Hock walked into the field with his head up and
his lips pressed together. He knew he was being
eyed in a curious, scornful manner, and the fact gave
him an air of defiance.</p>

<p>“Look at the nerve of him!” muttered Dick Starbright,
who could not get over the fact that Hock
had dropped that first fly in the Princeton game.</p>

<p>Dick had hoped to pitch that game through to a
successful finish, but the dropping of that fly had rattled
him so that Merriwell was compelled to take his
place. Starbright did not pause to consider that before
the long fly came the bases were filled. Nor did
it occur to him that, under ordinary circumstances, it
would have been a most fortunate thing for him had
the long fly been driven straight into the hands of
the center-fielder instead of going far to one side and
out of reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>He only knew that the center-fielder had dropped
the ball, lost it in the short grass near his feet, and
four scores had come chasing in for Princeton.</p>

<p>Mason could not help feeling the air of cool scorn,
but he had nerved himself to meet this sort of thing,
and he made a pretense that he did not mind it at all.</p>

<p>“It takes nerve to get along in this world,” declared
Ready fliply. “Now I’ve begun to learn playing
the cornet. How is that for nerve?”</p>

<p>“Everybody knows you have plenty of it,” said
Browning. “Learning to play the cornet, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Who is your teacher?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t one. I’m my own tooter.”</p>

<p>Then Jack got out of the way, for he knew the big
senior might smash him.</p>

<p>Merriwell met Mason.</p>

<p>“Just in time, Hock,” he said pleasantly. “We’re
going out for field practise. You know your position.”</p>

<p>Several students had come out to the field to witness
the practise. They heard what Frank said to
Hock, and it created a buzzing among them.</p>

<p>The men trotted onto the field, and Mason went
down to the middle garden.</p>

<p>Now, of course, there was a manager for the team,
although he was a mere figurehead. It was known
throughout the college that Merriwell was the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
manager, as well as the captain, and he could run
things to suit himself. But the ostensible manager
had been given a hint from the board of directors,
and he braced up to approach Frank. His name was
Filkins, and he could put on a great front.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell,” he observed pompously. “I wish
to speak with you.”</p>

<p>Frank nodded, and followed Filkins aside.</p>

<p>“It’s a serious matter,” Filkins began. “Of course
we rely on your judgment, Merriwell, but even the
best of us sometimes make&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;breaks, you understand.
Of course, I’m not casting any&mdash;er&mdash;reflection
on&mdash;on&mdash;anything you may have seen fit to do;
but it is the universal opinion that&mdash;ah&mdash;something
must be done. I don’t like to&mdash;to&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come to the point, Mr. Filkins,” urged Frank.
“Time is precious. What do you wish to say?”</p>

<p>He knew well enough what the fellow was driving
at, but Merry had no intention of helping him out.
Somehow Filkins’ air of pomposity vanished.</p>

<p>“I’m not doing this on my own accord,” he declared.
“But I’ve been compelled to do it. You understand?
As I said, we’re well pleased with your judgment generally;
but there is one matter that is not satisfactory.
We do not think center field is properly filled.”</p>

<p>“Is that it?” said Frank grimly. “Well what
about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would suggest a change.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“You will make it?” exclaimed Filkins, in great
relief.</p>

<p>“I did not say so.”</p>

<p>“But you said ‘very well.’”</p>

<p>“Which simply meant that I would hear your suggestion.”</p>

<p>Filkins’ relief changed to uneasiness again. He
had been instructed to be firm and impress on Merriwell
that a change must be made, and he had promised
to do so. Now, however, he found all his firmness
oozing before the steady gaze of that grim-faced
athlete.</p>

<p>“But you&mdash;you must act on it,” he said huskily.</p>

<p>“Must?” said Frank, still more grimly. “Who
says so?”</p>

<p>“Why, I&mdash;er&mdash;we&mdash;the board says so. There is
general dissatisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Filkins, I believe it is generally understood that
I am to use my own judgment in handling this team?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When I took hold of the nine it was in a very bad
way. Yale was desperate. I had an understanding
with you and the board of directors. You know what
followed. I was given full power. I turned out a
host of new men to practise, and out of them I found
some good timber for the nine, filling the very gaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that were open. I confess that many of the players
are my personal friends, but they have been trained
to play ball under me, not only here but last summer
and the summer before during vacation. I knew the
kind of stuff to be found in Browning, Gamp, and
Ready.</p>

<p>“Parker, who tried to make the team, and who
played with us last summer, did not succeed because
I found a better man. That man is Mason. He has
in him the making of a remarkable outfielder. He
has played well so far, with the exception of that last
game. He is not popular, and just because he lost that
game for us there has risen a general outcry, and an
attempt is being made to push him off the team. Some
of my own friends are helping, or trying to help, get
rid of him. But let me tell you this, Filkins: Until
I have further evidence of Mason’s incapacity, he remains
on the team. When I am satisfied that I have
made a mistake, I’ll drop him, but not a minute before.
That’s business, and you may report it to the
board.”</p>

<p>Then Frank left Filkins, and the fellow felt that
he hadn’t a leg to stand on.</p>

<p>“Great gash!” he gurgled, glaring after Merry.
“Think of it! Think of the captain of a ball-team
daring to talk to the manager like that! Oh, jiminy!
Never was another man at Yale could do it
and hold his job a minute. Merriwell knows he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
us in a hole. Just as he says, the team is made up
mainly of his friends, and they’d quit quicker than a
wink if anything were done to him. That would
leave us in the soup.”</p>

<p>It was true that never before had any man at Yale
possessed such complete authority and power. No
man but Merriwell could have obtained such a hold;
but he had it, and he felt that he was doing right in
standing by the position he had assumed.</p>

<p>So those who had gathered at the field expecting
Mason would be shelved if he appeared to practise
were greatly disappointed. Hock filled the middle
field, and the practise he put up that day was gilt-edged.</p>

<h2 class="no-brk"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<span class="fs70 lsp3">MASON’S CHALLENGE.</span></h2>


<p>“Mason!” cried Merriwell, who was batting to the
outfield.</p>

<p>Then he sent out a long, difficult fly, forcing Mason
to run for it as hard as he could.</p>

<p>Hock held it, though forced to take it on the dead
run.</p>

<p>“Gamp!”</p>

<p>Merry gave Joe one very much like that driven out
to Hock, and the New Hampshire youth made his
long legs fly as he pranced over the ground. He
gathered the fly in, whirled round, and sent it almost
on a line to the plate. Gamp was a wonderful
thrower, and he sometimes fancied showing off a
little.</p>

<p>“Benson!”</p>

<p>Frank cracked out a liner to Lib Benson in right
field. It was not straight at Benson, and he was compelled
to jump to get in front of it; but he took it
handsomely, giving Nash, Mullen, and Cowles a
chance to applaud.</p>

<p>In the meantime, another man was batting all kinds
of balls to the infield, keeping every one on the jump.
Pretty soon Frank changed places with the other batter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
He had given the outfielders the kind of work
that he felt was best for them, and now he wished to
see the infield practise.</p>

<p>Ready, covering second, was sent leaping after a
ground-skimmer.</p>

<p>“First!” rang out Merry’s voice.</p>

<p>Jack picked it up, and, without straightening, still
running, he snapped it to Browning.</p>

<p>“Second!”</p>

<p>The command came from Merry while the ball was
on its way to Bruce. Browning took it and threw,
to second without a moment’s delay.</p>

<p>Morgan had leaped to cover the bag, but he was a
trifle too slow, and he touched the ball with one hand
only.</p>

<p>“Ginger up!” commanded Frank promptly. “You
must cover that bag, Morgan, when Ready is after the
ball like that.”</p>

<p>Dade started to shrug his shoulders, but changed
his mind instantly, smiled a bit sweetly, and called
in a musical, good-natured voice:</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>And this was the same Dade Morgan who had
once seemed to be Frank Merriwell’s bitter and unrelenting
enemy. A great change had come over
Dade since the death of Santenel. Released from
the power of the hypnotist, Morgan was fast becoming
quite a different fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Next Frank drove a liner to Carson, who was on
third, and the Westerner took it with out-thrust hand.</p>

<p>“First!”</p>

<p>Berlin lined it across the diamond in a very pretty
manner.</p>

<p>“Home!”</p>

<p>Hodge was waiting, and the ball plunked into his
mitt.</p>

<p>“Second!”</p>

<p>Bart’s throwing to second was a feature of any
game. His short-arm throw was perfect, and he could
line a ball down to the second bag without getting
out of his tracks.</p>

<p>“Oh, Laura!” murmured Ready, as he took the
throw. “What a peach!”</p>

<p>“Home!”</p>

<p>Jack sent it back, and his throw was almost as
beautiful as Bart’s, but he made harder work of it.</p>

<p>Base-running, batting, and signal practise followed.
The team this year had a complete signal system, so
that every man could tell just what was to be done or
tried without a word being spoken by anybody. From
the bench, the box, or the coaching-lines Merry could
give directions, and he was sure an attempt would be
made to follow them. If two runners were on the
bases, one on first and one on second, Frank could
make a signal that would cause the batter to “take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
one,” while both runners knew they were to try a
“double steal” on the first delivery, and they started
together with no misunderstanding. Even if one of
them were cut off, the other was pretty sure to advance
a bag. A sacrifice could be called for by a
signal, a man could be directed to bunt or to try to
place the ball in any particular field. When Frank
was pitching he simply assumed certain positions that
caused the fielders to move to the right or left, to play
short or long, brought the infield in or sent it out, and
every player knew just what the kind of a ball he was
going to deliver.</p>

<p>But now the disagreement over Mason threatened
trouble. Frank knew the feeling of distrust, and lost
confidence was the very worst thing that could assail
a ball-team, and he was doing his best to give the
Southerner a chance to restore confidence to some
extent.</p>

<p>Mason never worked harder in a game. Not even
once did he drop a ball he could touch with his hands.
He ran in for them and ran out for them. He dug
them out of the dirt, pulled them down out of the
sky, and took them over his shoulder. When it came
to batting he seemed able to hit anything that might
be called a strike. He ran and slid bases handsomely.</p>

<p>Hodge watched with sour looks the practise of the
Southerner. Several of the players who had failed
to make the regular nine were on the field now, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the players a chance to come in to the bench and do
batting and base-running.</p>

<p>“What thinkest thou?” murmured Jack Ready, as
he saw Hodge gloomily watching Mason. “Perchance
he may redeem himself&mdash;not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is any hope that he will,” said
Bart harshly. “He’s one of these fellows that can do
almost anything in practise, but is no earthly good in
real work.”</p>

<p>“Thinkest thou so?” chirped Jack. “Then it’s plain
that you do not agree with our great and mighty
chieftain. He must think otherwise, else he’d not retain
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Merry’s got a fool notion that the fellow can
play. Usually, I’m ready to stand by anything Merry
says, but in this case I’m not, for I know he’s wrong.”</p>

<p>“Perchance you do not love this Mason, whose front
name is Hock?”</p>

<p>“I never did, but I’ve had to tolerate him.”</p>

<p>“He has ways which much resemble some of yours,”
ventured Jack.</p>

<p>Bart scowled.</p>

<p>“That may be true, and I think likely it’s why I
dislike him; but I swear I never entertained some of
his fool notions about dignity and the degrading influence
of honest work. I respect a man who has
enough snap in himself to get out and hustle. Mason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
looks with pity and disdain on a man who has to
get out and hustle. That’s where his cursed Southern
training makes him a cad!”</p>

<p>“I myself love work,” asserted Ready. “I love it
so much that I can peacefully lie down beside it and
sleep almost any time. Besides, there are so many
others working that I don’t see as if it would be important
whether I helped them or not.”</p>

<p>“It would be a good thing if Mason had to get out
and make his way in the world. Perhaps it would
teach him not to curl his nose up at honest people
who labor.”</p>

<p>“It may be thou art right; but I think he’d go into
politics and become a congressman before he would
stoop to work. Some men, you know, will suffer any
degradation rather than toil.”</p>

<p>“He needs to be taken down a peg or two,” said
Bart. “I hate a cad, and Mason is a cad of the first
water.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to get into a fight here,” said the voice
of Mason himself, who had, unperceived, come in
from the field after making the round of the bases;
“but, sah, if you want to back up your talk, sah, I’ll
meet you anywhere you like, sah.”</p>

<p>“La! la!” murmured Ready. “Methinks I smell
smoke!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to fight with you,” said Hodge. “I
wouldn’t waste my time thrashing a fellow like you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Mason’s face was white, and his eyes glittered.</p>

<p>“You must agree to fight me, sah,” he said passionately,
though trying to hold himself in check.</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Because, sah, if you do not, by the gods! I’ll
brand you as a miserable coward, and I’ll slap your
face in the presence of these fellows.”</p>

<p>Bart saw that Mason really meant fight. Now, to
tell the truth, Hodge was not adverse to a fight with
Hock, and it gave him real satisfaction when he saw
that he could truthfully declare he had been forced
into it. He had not wished Merriwell to think he
would seek such a quarrel.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he said, “if you will have it, all right;
but I call on Ready to witness that I did not force this
affair.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” nodded Jack. “I am ready to
witness that, but I had much rather witness the scrap.
Say, I’m to be one of the guests of honor, am I nit?”</p>

<p>“I leave that to Mr. Mason,” said Bart coolly.</p>

<p>Hock made no reply. Instead, he said:</p>

<p>“I’ll see you, Mr. Hodge, sah, immediately after
practise.”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” said Bart.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">WHO WON THE FIGHT?</span></h2>


<p>How and when Mason and Hodge disappeared
from the field Ready never knew; but disappear they
did, and Jack went about wildly seeking to learn in
which direction they had departed.</p>

<p>“Oh, lud! oh, lud!” he moaned. “I wouldn’t miss
the circus for two dollars in real money!”</p>

<p>“What circus?” asked Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Why, the mill,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the mill?”</p>

<p>“The scrap.”</p>

<p>“Hey? A scrap? Who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hodge and Mason.”</p>

<p>Merriwell grasped Ready by the arm, demanded
to know all about it, and Jack told him what had happened.</p>

<p>“It must be stopped!” exclaimed Frank, who fancied
he saw no end of trouble on the nine arising from
such an encounter. “We must find out which way
they have gone.”</p>

<p>But though they tried to do so, they did not learn
until it was almost dark that the two young men had
been seen walking swiftly toward Edgewood Park.</p>

<p>Neither of the enemies was found. When they returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to college Hodge was not in his room. Some
time later he had arrived, but his door was locked
and no one gained admittance.</p>

<p>All the following day Hodge and Mason kept to
their rooms. Of course, Frank gained admission,
although both fellows were reported “ill.”</p>

<p>Mason was wearing a beefsteak poultice over both
eyes, while Hodge was making liberal applications of
witch-hazel and arnica and soap liniment.</p>

<p>Mason would not say a word about the fight. Nor
would Hodge.</p>

<p>When Merry tried to draw Mason out he closed up
like a clam. Hodge did the same. Neither man would
speak of the other.</p>

<p>Of course, it was known by this time that there had
been some kind of an encounter between these two,
and the students generally were interested to learn
how it had resulted.</p>

<p>Finding Merriwell had obtained admission to Bart’s
room, Jack Ready sought it. His second knock on
Hodge’s door caused Bart to turn the key in the lock.</p>

<p>“Important, dear boy,” declared Jack, as he rushed
right in. “Refuse me! Awfully dark here. Why
don’t you run up your curtain?”</p>

<p>Ready was about to lift the curtain when Hodge
harshly growled for him to let it alone.</p>

<p>“Refuse me!” exclaimed Jack again. “Are you
ill?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bad headache,” said Bart. “What in thunder do
you want? You’re enough to make a well man sick!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully,” chirped Ready. “I don’t mind
if I do sit down.” He took a chair. “Now, what I
wanted to see you about is this: You and I agree on
one point&mdash;Mason is N. G. on the nine. He lacks
sand.”</p>

<p>“Who said so?” demanded Hodge.</p>

<p>“Why, I though somebody told me you said so.”</p>

<p>“Think again.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is not the man we want for center field.”</p>

<p>“Are you managing the nine?”</p>

<p>“No, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better dry up and let other people
run it.”</p>

<p>“Ye gods!” gasped Ready. “I fail to understand
you. Anyhow, you cheated me out of my just dues.
I was to see that scrap. I suppose you licked him?”</p>

<p>Hodge did not answer.</p>

<p>“I say I suppose you thrashed the cad?” repeated
Jack.</p>

<p>Still Bart was silent.</p>

<p>“But,” Ready continued, “I didn’t think you’d shut
yourself up and go into mourning over it. Was it a
hard job?”</p>

<p>“If you have anything you wish to see me about,
come to the point. If you haven’t, get out. You
make my headache worse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“My! my! how touchy you are!” murmured Jack.
“You need some spring bitters.”</p>

<p>“You’re an ass!” snapped Bart.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” smiled Jack. “So am I. There are
lots of us to keep you company. Where did you
fight?”</p>

<p>“Will you go?”</p>

<p>“By me soul!” cried Ready; “I have a suspicion
that you did not fight at all! You have shut yourself
in your room to avoid meeting him. You are
afraid of him, Hodge.”</p>

<p>But even this did not lead Bart to assert that the
fight had taken place.</p>

<p>“It is insinuated around the campus,” lied Ready,
“that Mason thrashed you. Will you give me authority,
as a particular friend, to contradict the report?”</p>

<p>“I will give you authority to mind your own business.”</p>

<p>“Great gash!” whooped Jack. “You don’t mean to
confess that he did thrash you?”</p>

<p>Bart opened the door.</p>

<p>“You get out,” he said fiercely, “or I’ll throw you
out!”</p>

<p>“La! la!” said Ready. “Isn’t it too bad? Just to
think that a cad like him should thrash a man like
you! Oh, luddy me! how could it be!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Bart strode over to Jack, whom he seized by the
collar.</p>

<p>“There’s the door!” he growled.</p>

<p>“Nothing remarkable about it that I can see,” said
Ready. “Just a plain, ordinary door.”</p>

<p>Bart yanked him over to it.</p>

<p>“But a first-rate door to go out of,” he said, as he
ejected Jack. “Come round again&mdash;when you’re invited.”</p>

<p>Slam!&mdash;the door closed in Ready’s face, and the
key turned in the lock.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it sad!” sobbed the queer fellow to himself.
“Just to think that a good man like Hodge should
be thrashed by a fellow like Mason! Oh, me! oh,
my!”</p>

<p>Then he sought Mason’s room, but Hock would
not admit him at all.</p>

<p>Late that evening Mason escaped from his room
and visited the little store of a man who “decorated
black eyes.” There Hock had his eyes painted in a
most artistic manner, and the next morning he did
not wash his face when he rose from his bed, though
he took a cold sponge bath and brushed and combed
his hair.</p>

<p>In some manner Hodge had managed to hide traces
of the conflict, and the two students put up a great
bluff. This simply served to make every one all the
more anxious to learn the particulars of the fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must have been a corker,” said Ready. “I feel
that I have missed one of the greatest events of the
century.”</p>

<p>Ready knew something about Bart’s fighting-abilities,
and, for all of the talk he had made to Hodge,
something convinced him that Hodge had come out
the victor. Never, however, could he induce Hodge
to confirm this belief.</p>

<p>After a time it became apparent to all that the two
men must have agreed to say nothing about the result
of the encounter, no matter what it was. Without
doubt this agreement had been made before the
engagement began.</p>

<p>Who whipped? That question remained unanswered
to the end of time, for, true to any agreement
they may have made, neither youth would speak of it.
They would not even acknowledge that there had been
a fight.</p>

<p>But Mason played center field in the next ball-game.
Only one chance was given him, and he accepted
it prettily. His batting was good, as he got
two clean singles. He ran bases well, but did nothing
sensational.</p>

<p>All this proved neither one thing nor the other, for
the game was regarded as sure for Yale from the
start, the team pitted against the blue being from
one of the minor colleges. In a game of that sort
the weak man may show up well, as he has plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
confidence. Against a strong team the weak man
may lose his courage and go all to pieces, believing
defeat is almost certain.</p>

<p>Merriwell, however, was well satisfied with Mason’s
work. He found an opportunity to quietly tell
the Southerner so, and Hock’s eyes showed that he
appreciated this.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sah,” he said. “I did as well as I
could. But I ought to have had another hit. I tried
to drop the ball behind second, but made a misjudgment,
so the baseman got it.”</p>

<p>“I noticed,” said Merry, “that you were trying to
place all your hits. That’s the way to do. Men who
simply try to hit the ball out any old place never
make as good batters as place-hitters.”</p>

<p>“But sometimes,” said Hock, with a bit of a smile,
“I find I’m up against a pitcher that I’m right glad to
hit out to any old place. Pitchers are not all alike.”</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s quite true; but a bunting-team can make
the slickest pitcher work hard. The trouble with
most teams is that they never practise bunting. I’ve
seen a game won off a clever pitcher after the seventh
inning by a team turning to on finding they could
not hit the ball out and going to bunting man after
man as they came up. It rattled the pitcher and broke
the luck of his side.”</p>

<p>Hodge made no further protests against Mason.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
He knew it was quite useless to do so as long as
Merry had decided to keep the Southerner in defiance
to popular clamor.</p>

<p>But still, deep in his heart, Bart continued to think
Frank had made a mistake in judgment.</p>

<span class="fs70">MASON PROVES HIS NERVE.</span></h2>


<p>The first circus of the season had come to town.
Now, when a circus strikes New Haven, Yale men
take it in with a vengeance. Something about a circus
sets their coltish blood to dancing, and they are
bound to patronize it. They take in all the side-shows,
too, and it is apparent that the most of them enjoy
the side-shows more than the performance under the
main tent.</p>

<p>Behold Jack Ready and a party of kindred spirits
taking in the “sights.” Of course, Ready has
dragged Joe Gamp along, and whenever he can start
the New Hampshire youth to “haw-hawing” he delights
to do so. Starbright is with them, and he smiles
and enjoys everything. Big Bingham chaffs with
Ready, who is sometimes witty, sometimes “chestnutty,”
but always eccentric.</p>

<p>“Come in and behold Melba, the most beautiful
woman snake-charmer in the world!” cries the barker
outside the side-show.</p>

<p>“Your royal giblets,” says Ready, “didst ever see
Weary Wiggins? Nay? Then be careful of thy
statements, for he is something of a snake-charmer
himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“G’wan!” retorts the barker. “Wot yer givin’ us!
You wouldn’t know a snake-charmer if you saw one.
Now, honest, did yer ever see one?”</p>

<p>“Well, you are very nearly the first I’ve ever
seen,” Ready answered breezily. “Your nose is your
own advertisement, sir. You can provide your own
snakes with a pint of bug-juice.”</p>

<p>“T’ink ye’re smart, don’t yer!” retorted the fellow
angrily. “Some time yer’ll get yer face dented
if you shoots off yer lip so free. If I had time, I’d
’tend to der job meself.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry you haven’t the time. I’d like
to go out behind the big tent and soothe you to sleep.
I am a very soothing chap.”</p>

<p>To this the barker made another angry retort, and
Jack and his friends laughed, bought tickets, and entered
the tent.</p>

<p>When they were inside Jack began to lecture on
the “wonders” there assembled. He gave them a little
“game of talk” about the tattooed man, the Chinese
giant, the “armless acrobat,” the fat woman, and
other freaks on exhibition. When, however, he started
in to call attention to a long-whiskered farmer from
the country he came near getting into trouble.</p>

<p>“You sassy young cub!” roared the old farmer,
clenching his fists and glaring at Jack, “I’d good mind
to smash ye!”</p>

<p>Jack looked very frightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Honestly?” he gasped. “You wouldn’t do that to
a poor orphing bhoy, would you?”</p>

<p>“Think ye’re funny tellin’ folks about the wind
blowin’ through my whiskers, don’t ye?” snorted the
farmer. “When you have more whiskers, mebbe ye’ll
hev some more brains to go with ’em!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, by gum!” agreed Gamp, sidling up
to the farmer. “Give it to him, mum-mister. He’s
sassed mum-most everybuddy.”</p>

<p>This made the old farmer fiercer than ever, and he
shook his fist under Jack’s nose, roaring:</p>

<p>“Dang my boots! but I believe I will smash ye!”</p>

<p>His wife, a mild little woman with an umbrella,
now grabbed him by the arm, timidly crying:</p>

<p>“Don’t ye git into a row, Joel! The last time you
was to town you got into trouble with these here college
chaps, an’ they made the perlice believe ye was
crazy. Came nigh puttin’ ye inter a ’sylum.”</p>

<p>“Ah-he!” cried Ready. “’Tis he!” And he pointed
a darting finger at the farmer. “The police have been
looking for you ever since. Will somebody call an
officer? Wait; I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“No, ye don’t!” shouted the farmer, clutching Jack’s
arm. “I’ll thrash ye if ye open your mouth to do it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joel! Joel!” quavered his wife. “You’re alwus
gittin’ inter trouble! Come erway before ye git arrested!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>She tried to drag him away, but he turned on her
savagely, snarling:</p>

<p>“Don’t be such a dratted fool, old woman! Let
me alone, can’t ye!”</p>

<p>Then she fired up.</p>

<p>“Joel Haskins,” she exclaimed, “don’t ye darst to
call me a fool right before all these people! If ye
do, I’ll pull ev’ry hair outer your old head!”</p>

<p>“Take your hands offen me!” he retorted. “All
women is fools!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a libel on the fair sex!” said Ready.
“A man who will speak thus to a beautiful and charming
wife deserves to be drawn and quartered! I don’t
see how such an old brute ever succeeded in marrying
such a refined lady.”</p>

<p>“He is an old brute!” agreed the wife.</p>

<p>“Don’t call me an old brute, Marthy Jane!” roared
the man savagely.</p>

<p>“You called me a fool first.”</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t ye showin’ it? Heaven sakes! but I’ve
put up with enough of your nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Oh, hev ye?” she shrilly screamed. “And you
will talk like this before folks, will ye?”</p>

<p>Then, in her excitement, she swung her umbrella
aloft and brought it down on his head with a whack.</p>

<p>The delighted college boys roared with laughter
and urged her on. She hit him again.</p>

<p>“Hey! Stop it!” he squawked, holding up his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to protect his head. “I never saw such a dratted
woman!”</p>

<p>She smashed the umbrella to pieces before the
showmen could stop her. Then both the farmer and
his wife were escorted from the tent, the woman
sputtering at him and he growling back at her.</p>

<p>Ready looked sad and regretful.</p>

<p>“Alas!” he sighed. “At least, she was once a lass.
She has outgrown it somewhat!”</p>

<p>“Ready,” said a voice, “you ought to be ashamed
of yourself. You caused the trouble and ruined the
show for those old people.”</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell was the speaker, and, despite his
attempt to reprove Jack, he could not help smiling.</p>

<p>“It is ever thus,” sobbed Jack. “Whenever I am
having my loveliest time somebody comes along and
calls me down.”</p>

<p>At this moment the announcement was made that
Melba would give her wonderful performance with
the snakes. The lecturer explained that one of the
snakes was a mighty python “ya-a-ahmsteen feet in
length.”</p>

<p>Melba arose. She was really pretty for a professional
snake-charmer, and could not have been more
than twenty-three or four years old.</p>

<p>“Yum, yum!” said Ready. “Would you believe
it! She’s the first one I ever saw who didn’t look
like a snake-charmer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s new at the business,” declared Frank.</p>

<p>Melba opened the case in which the snakes were
kept. She took them out one by one and twined
them about her arms, waist, and neck. She was very
pale while she did it, and the boys could see that she
trembled a little. No one guyed her. For once the
irrepressible Ready was silent.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge had entered the tent and was near the
platform.</p>

<p>Having handled the smaller snakes, Melba put them
back in the case and prepared to take out the python.
She was more agitated than ever.</p>

<p>Frank decided that the girl really was afraid of the
snakes, and pitied her. The act was unpleasant to
him, and he turned away.</p>

<p>Carefully the girl took out the python. The snake
was a large one, and those near the stand fancied he
seemed rather more active than the others. With care
Melba handled the great snake, forcing a smile to her
painted lips. The reptile coiled and moved its head.</p>

<p>All at once, without warning, Melba dropped to the
platform in a dead faint. Women screamed and men
shouted and pushed away.</p>

<p>Hodge was close to the platform, and he saw the
girl had fallen on the snake in such a manner that the
weight of her body was squeezing it. This was angering
the snake.</p>

<p>Instantly Bart leaped onto the platform and lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the unconscious girl to take her weight off the serpent,
at the same time calling for an assistant to
come and give him aid.</p>

<p>Then something happened that filled all beholders
with horror. With a swift movement, the snake
threw a coil round Bart’s legs. Another shout of
horror went up from the men. The python twisted
about Hodge with great swiftness, its head rising
higher and higher.</p>

<p>Such snakes have strength in their natural state to
crush the ribs of an ox. If the thing were to twine
itself about Bart’s body and exert pressure the young
college man would be killed before the eyes of the
horrified spectators.</p>

<p>Out of the throng leaped a youth, who hastily
snatched from his hip pocket a shining revolver.</p>

<p>It was Hock Mason. The Southerner leaped to the
edge of the platform, with the weapon uplifted.</p>

<p>“Steady!” said Bart, in a calm voice. “Got to
smash his head with the first shot! If you
don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mason had raised his revolver, but he could not
get a shot at the head of the snake without great
risk of fatally wounding Bart.</p>

<p>“Here!” he cried, dropping the weapon. “I’ll hold
the creature! Somebody take that pistol and shoot
its head off!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, without the least hesitation, he grasped the
snake with both hands just back of its head.</p>

<p>Fortunate, indeed, it was that Frank Merriwell was
at hand. He had the revolver almost as soon as it
touched the ground. As Mason held the snake’s head
for a moment two shots rang out, and both bullets
hit the reptile’s head fairly. Its coils loosened from
Bart, and Mason flung the squirming thing aside,
where it thrashed and twisted on the ground.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Hodge to Mason.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, sah,” said Mason politely.</p>

<p>Never again as long as he lived would Bart Hodge
say that the man from South Carolina lacked nerve.
Whatever else could be said of him, that accusation
could not be made against him.</p>

<p>Both Hodge and Mason were the heroes of the
day.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp3">THE FIRST SCORE.</span></h2>


<p>Princeton was out to win the last game of the series
with Yale. The two clubs had met on neutral ground,
and, remembering their slump in football, the Tigers
meant to down Yale in order to reestablish Princeton’s
standing in athletic sports as one of the “Big Three.”</p>

<p>Of late Columbia had loomed ominously on the
horizon, and there were those who prophesied that
she would succeed in pushing Princeton out and getting
herself accepted as one of the three first colleges
in manly sports.</p>

<p>Starbright had asked to go into the box against
Princeton again. Hard work and considerable worry
was telling on Merriwell, so that he was not in his
best form, while the big freshman felt fit to pitch
against National League champions.</p>

<p>Morgan longed, also, to try his hand against the
Princeton nine, but Merry could not spare Dade from
the position he was filling in such splendid style. For
Morgan had turned out to be one of the cleverest
short-stops seen at Yale for several years. He could
cover a vast amount of ground, could pick up grounders
cleanly, could gather in liners and flies, and his
throwing across to first delighted the spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>To tell the truth, Dade’s pitching aspirations had
never seemed to please the fans at Yale, but he soon
won a way into their hearts after Merriwell placed
him at short. This placing came about by accident.
One night during practise Morgan got out at short,
the regular man being gone, and the way he got
around amazed everybody. Frank tried him there in
the very next game, and Dade remained there after
that.</p>

<p>This cut the regular pitching-stock down a head.
Of course, Dade could be used in the box if necessary,
but <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Meriwell believed in'">Merriwell believed in</ins> keeping the team unchanged
and in position just as far as possible, it having been
his experience that shifting men about was extremely
bad policy.</p>

<p>As this was the deciding game between the colleges,
Princeton turned out as large a crowd of rooters as
did Yale. The bleachers on one side of the field were
packed with the admirers of the orange and black,
while the other side fluttered blue with Yale flags.</p>

<p>It was two-thirty when the Princeton players trotted
onto the field, being given a royal greeting by their
admirers.</p>

<p>At once the men prepared for practise.</p>

<p>The Tigers began to sing a stirring battle song,
and the men to work on the field with snap and earnestness.</p>

<p>This practise work was watched closely by both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
sides. It was plain that Princeton was in her very best
form, and her players had come out to win.</p>

<p>Confidence is of great importance in a game of ball,
but overconfidence is dangerous. Princeton had confidence,
but knowing from past experience what she
was up against, she was not overconfident.</p>

<p>The infield worked fast and sure, picking up everything
clean, making handsome throws, and never hesitating,
nor fumbling.</p>

<p>Lib Benson’s friends were together in a group.</p>

<p>“This is going to be a tight old game,” said Irving
Nash anxiously. “There is no doubt about it.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” nodded Mat Mullen. “But Old Eli
must win. It would be something awful to lose the
series to Princeton!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it!” gasped Chan Webb. “But there are
some fellows who still claim that we’ll lose if the game
depends on Mason in a tight place.”</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” asserted Gil Cowles. “Merriwell
dropped Castlemon for work not so poor as that
of Mason in the last Princeton game; but Castlemon
was not one of his particular friends.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we all know Merriwell will not do any man
an intentional wrong,” said Nash; “but it does seem
he has been influenced for Mason by a strange liking.”</p>

<p>“Look at those chaps practise!” said Mullen. “I
don’t think I’ve seen such clever work this season.”</p>

<p>“But you know that it often happens that a team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
shows up well in practise and plays a poor game,”
said Webb.</p>

<p>“Something tells me it isn’t going to happen that
way to-day.”</p>

<p>“Look&mdash;look at Jerome pull down that fly out in
center field!” urged Cowles. “Now, there is a fielder.
If we had him in Mason’s place!”</p>

<p>“Mason may be all right to-day,” said Nash. “Let’s
hope he will be. But this is a critical game, and he
seems to lack something in critical times.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t seem to lack anything when he grabbed
that snake and held the thing for Merriwell to shoot
its head off,” said Webb.</p>

<p>“That was a piece of nerve,” nodded Nash. “Even
Hodge is not now making claims that Mason lacks
nerve.”</p>

<p>“I’d give ten dollars,” asserted Mullen, “to know
which of those fellows got the best of that fight.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was Hodge,” said Webb.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet my life it wasn’t Mason!” exclaimed
Cowles.</p>

<p>“Then it must have been a draw,” grinned Mullen.</p>

<p>There was a stir, and then the men down in front
gave a signal with waving arms. Onto the field
trotted the Yale team, and the Yale bleachers rose
and greeted the heroes with a great roar of welcome.</p>

<p>“There’s Benson!” cried Nash. “Who’d thought
at one time that he’d ever be playing ball under Merriwell?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Why, he was a leader in everything against
Merriwell.”</p>

<p>Merry spoke to the Princeton captain, and then
the Tigers were called in from the field, Yale trotting
out to get some practise.</p>

<p>“Of course, Merriwell will pitch this game straight
through,” said Mullen.</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t he’ll display poor judgment,” asserted
Cowles. “He can’t afford to fool round.”</p>

<p>But Frank Merriwell was not feeling like pitching.
In the pocket of his coat which he had left in the
dressing-room was a letter from Inza Burrage, and
that letter contained the information that Inza’s father
was dead.</p>

<p>Inza was now quite alone in the world.</p>

<p>Merry’s heart was torn with sympathy for the beautiful
girl whom he knew was almost heart-broken with
grief, and he longed to turn from the baseball-field
and seek some place where no one might disturb him.</p>

<p>So Starbright was to have an opportunity to gratify
his ambition to again pitch against Princeton.</p>

<p>The practise of the Yale team was not nearly as
snappy as that of the nine from New Jersey. Somehow
the gloom that had fallen on Merriwell seemed
to communicate itself to the whole team.</p>

<p>The spectators felt it. The Yale crowd started to
singing to rouse up some spirit and vim, but there
was a mournful note about it that added to the gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>The umpire came onto the field. Princeton went
first to bat, and Dick Starbright entered the pitcher’s
box, while Merry sat on the bench.</p>

<p>Following was the batting-order of the two teams
as given to the scorers:</p>

</table></div>

<p>Only one change had been made on the Princeton
team since the last game with them. Willis was a
new man on second base. Harding, the former player
in that position, having sprained his ankle. But it
was said that Willis was regarded as a better man
than Harding, who had retained his position through
virtue of having played it the previous season.</p>

<p>Vinton was Princeton’s cleverest pitcher. Before
him had fallen all of the minor teams he had pitched
against. He had a wild and bewildering delivery, and
he varied it in a most remarkable manner, so that it
was impossible to tell just what all his contortions
meant.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” rang out the voice of the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Clackson picked out a bat and stepped up to the
plate. Starbright prepared to deliver the ball.</p>

<p>Clackson was regarded as Princeton’s safest single
hitter. He could not drive out a long hit, but he could
place his hits beautifully, having a way of driving the
ball through any opening left in the infield.</p>

<p>Starbright had tried Clackson on all sorts of twists
and benders, and he had found the fellow able to hit
almost anything. It was a mystery to know just what
sort of a ball to give the fellow.</p>

<p>Starbright tried him with an out curve, but Clackson
calmly let it pass.</p>

<p>“One ball,” was the decision.</p>

<p>Then Dick put one close to the fellow’s body, but
the latter simply stepped back and let that pass.</p>

<p>“Two balls!”</p>

<p>The big Yale freshman followed with a sharp drop.</p>

<p>Clackson swung at it and missed.</p>

<p>“One strike.”</p>

<p>“Fooled him that time,” thought Dick exultantly.</p>

<p>Then he used a rise, but it was above the latter’s
shoulders, and Clackson did not offer.</p>

<p>“Three balls.”</p>

<p>“Bad hole!” thought Starbright. “But I can put
’em over if I want to.”</p>

<p>He felt that his control was good, and so he followed
with another drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Whiz&mdash;went the bat, but the ball was not touched.</p>

<p>“Two strikes.”</p>

<p>“That’s better!” thought Dick, with relief. “He
doesn’t seem able to connect with a drop to-day.”</p>

<p>Fancying Clackson would not be looking for another
drop, Dick ventured to give it to him.</p>

<p>The Princeton man had his teeth shut, and he hit
the ball a nice easy little tap that dropped it just over
the second-baseman’s head, but far enough back so
Ready could not get it.</p>

<p>The Princeton crowd cheered. The first man up
had obtained a hit, which was starting the game right.</p>

<p>Leverage followed Clackson. He grinned at Starbright
in a most derisive manner as, with a flirt of
his head, he tossed a waving mane of yellow hair out
of his eyes.</p>

<p>Dick smiled back, but he remembered that Leverage
was a “bad un,” for he had given Dick trouble
in the last game, besides lifting the long fly out to
Mason while Merriwell was pitching.</p>

<p>But Starbright fancied the batter would wait to
give Clackson an opportunity to try to steal, and so,
after letting the runner get a little start the big freshman
whistled a ball straight over.</p>

<p>Starbright did this because he had absolute confidence
in Hodge, knowing Bart could put a ball down
to second like a bullet from a rifle.</p>

<p>But it did seem that Starbright had delayed too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
long, for Clackson was away toward second and running
like a deer.</p>

<p>It scarcely appeared that the ball rested fairly in
Bart’s big mitt before his right hand went back and
shot it toward second. Starbright seemed forced to
crouch a little to let that beautiful liner go over.</p>

<p>“Slide!” roared the coachers.</p>

<p>The runner flung himself forward and slid along
the ground toward the bag.</p>

<p>With a languid motion, Ready took the handsome
throw and put the ball onto the sliding man just a
moment before Clackson’s hand reached the bag.</p>

<p>“Out!” declared the umpire, as Ready coolly tossed
the ball to Starbright.</p>

<p>Then a wild roar went up from the Yale side. The
crowd appreciated this kind of work, and a great
cheer rose to the sky.</p>

<p>When the cheer subsided, some twenty or more
fellows rose in a body and loudly chanted in chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“That’s Hodge&mdash;he’s a dandy!</p>
<p class="verse2">That’s Hodge&mdash;he’s a beaut!</p>
<p class="verse0">He’s swift; he is handy;</p>
<p class="verse2">He can shoot the double-shoot.</p>
<p class="verse0">Look out! he’s a ripper;</p>
<p class="verse2">Run fast or you’re done!</p>
<p class="verse0">Ha! ha! See him zip her!</p>
<p class="verse2">Well, say&mdash;that’s Hodge! This is fun!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Yale crowd greeted this with further cheering
and laughter, and the young men sat down feeling
very well satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right,” declared Walpole, the captain of
the Princeton team. “He can’t do it every time.”</p>

<p>“Just keep your men going down to second and
see,” smiled Merry.</p>

<p>A strike had been called on Leverage. Starbright
was cool and cautious, and he tried to coax the fellow
into swinging at some wide ones, but the batter could
not be coaxed thus easily. Two balls were called, and
then Dick ventured to give Leverage a high one.</p>

<p>The batter hit it, sent it up into the air, and, when
it fell, Browning had it back of the foul line.</p>

<p>“Man is out!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>Another roar from the Yale crowd. Princeton was
not so happy now. The game that had started off
so well was beginning to look different.</p>

<p>Walpole himself came up to the plate. He cracked
the very first one Starbright delivered. It was a
corker, too. The spectators rose up and watched that
ball sailing off toward center field.</p>

<p>Could the fielder get under it? At first it seemed
there was no show for Mason to do so, but he was
running like the wind, covering ground in a most surprising
manner.</p>

<p>Walpole scudded down to first. Those watching
Mason declared at first that he could not touch the
ball. Then they changed their minds.</p>

<p>“He’ll reach it!” cried some of the Yale men.</p>

<p>“But he can’t handle it!” asserted others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>The suspense was great. At the last moment it
seemed the ball would go beyond Mason’s reach, but
he made a great leap into the air for it, and it stuck
in his hands.</p>

<p>“He’s got it!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;he’s lost it!”</p>

<p>The ball struck Hock’s hands, but did not strike
them fairly, and away it flew.</p>

<p>Down came Mason, but he made a dive in the direction
the ball had taken, while Walpole raced on
to second base. The ball had disappeared into a tiny
hollow, and Hock could not see it at once. He was
almost blind from disappointment over his failure to
catch it, and that added to his trouble in seeing it.</p>

<p>Walpole raced to third.</p>

<p>“Home!” shrieked the coacher, making gestures for
the runner to keep right on.</p>

<p>Mason was straightening up with the ball in his
hand.</p>

<p>Walpole kept straight on for home, and Mason
threw to try to stop him.</p>

<p>It was a very good throw, being sent in to bound
once, but though it came into Bart’s hands handsomely,
the runner slid across the base, and the first
score had been made for Princeton.</p>


    <div class="chapter"></div>

<span class="fs70">IN THE FACE OF DEFEAT.</span></h2>


<p>The first score had been made off a muffed ball by
Mason. True it was thoroughly excusable, but the
fact that Mason made it caused many to look at it in
a different light.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” growled Gil Cowles. “Now will
Merriwell pull him out?”</p>

<p>“He made a good bid for it,” said Nash.</p>

<p>“But he didn’t get it,” sneered Cowles. “He simply
knocked his ball aside so that it was lost, which
gave Walpole a chance to score. Mason is directly
responsible for the first score made by Princeton. In
the last game he was responsible for more than half
the scores made!”</p>

<p>“Merriwell will have to take him out now,” said
Mullen.</p>

<p>But Frank Merriwell had no thought of taking
Mason out for that piece of work. He knew there
was not one fielder in twenty who could have touched
that ball. Mason had come very near getting it. Had
he caught it, it would have been one of the most remarkable
and sensational outfield plays of the season.</p>

<p>Hodge said not a word, but he did look toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Frank inquiringly. Starbright’s face wore an expression
of disgust.</p>

<p>“Hard luck, boys; that’s all,” said Frank quietly.</p>

<p>“Take him out!” shouted somebody on the Yale
side.</p>

<p>Mason heard that cry, and it cut him like a keen
knife.</p>

<p>“Gods!” he growled, through his teeth, “I’d never
have been here if Merriwell hadn’t insisted. Luck is
against me, that’s all!”</p>

<p>Merritt, the next batter, was one of the heavy hitters
of the Princeton nine. He picked out a good one
and lammed it hard. It went sailing away toward
left field.</p>

<p>Starbright was being hit rather freely.</p>

<p>It seemed that Gamp would have difficulty in getting
under the ball, but he tore over the earth and
pulled it down with one hand while at full speed.</p>

<p>That electrified the Yale side, and the crowd of
witnesses on the blue bleachers rose up and howled.</p>

<p>“There’s the man to put in center field!” shrieked
somebody.</p>

<p>The Yale team came in from the field, Mason’s face
looking hard and grim.</p>

<p>“You made a good bid for that fly, Hock,” said
Merriwell openly. “If you’d held it, it would have
been a marvel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>This brought a bit of color to the fellow’s cheeks.
Ready advanced to the plate.</p>

<p>“Move your outfielders back,” he chirped. “Enlarge
the enclosure. I am going to disturb the atmosphere
with a severe shock. Now, watch out.”</p>

<p>Vinton’s lips curled, and he gave Jack a slow out
curve.</p>

<p>Ready had a long bat, and he reached for that ball,
caught it on the tip of the “slugger,” and sent it
whistling over the head of the second-baseman.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed Jack, as he pranced down to
first. “Also ho! ho! That’s the time you found yourself
up against the real thing, Vinton, old mark. Just
give me one of the same every time I come to bat,
will you?”</p>

<p>Vinton shrugged his shoulders, but seemed to give
Ready no further attention. However, as Jack played
off, the pitcher suddenly snapped the ball over to first
in an attempt to catch him.</p>

<p>Ready got back.</p>

<p>“Slow, Vint,” he said. “You seem to be in a
trance. Can’t you move quicker, old cinch?”</p>

<p>Vinton kept Jack dodging back to the base for some
seconds, but Ready attempted a steal very promptly
on the first ball delivered. He might not have reached
second in safety, but the catcher was bothered a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
about throwing, which gave the runner barely time to
slide down.</p>

<p>“Slow again!” chuckled Ready, as he lay on the
ground with his hand on the bag. “Oh, I’m harder
to catch than the elusive will-o’-the-wisp. La! la!
What an easy thing this game is going to be!”</p>

<p>But Jack could not steal third, and he was not taking
another desperate chance just then. He had
reached second to prevent a double play, and it was
lucky that he did so, for Carson batted a grounder
straight into Clackson’s hands and was thrown out at
first with ease. Had Ready been forced on that hit,
both men must have been put out.</p>

<p>Browning hit the second ball pitched and sent it
flying past the head of Walpole out into extreme right
field. That let him down to first, while Ready took
third.</p>

<p>It was Starbright’s turn.</p>

<p>“Here is where we tie the score without an effort,”
declared Ready. “Oh, luddy me! What a good, soft
thing this is!”</p>

<p>Browning was not a great base-runner, but he took
chances and stole second on the first ball pitched. The
catcher threw to the short-stop, who came in to take
the throw and cut Ready off if he tried to score. But
Jack was onto that game, and he pranced off third
only to prance back again, with a merry ha-ha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Starbright, however, although a good hitter, could
not meet the ball fairly, and he went out on a foul
fly.</p>

<p>Morgan walked up to the plate, ready for anything.
Morgan was a good hitter, and Vinton knew it, so
the Princeton pitcher became too cautious, with the
result that Morgan, who waited well, got his base on
balls.</p>

<p>Gamp was a long hitter, and the outfielders moved
back a little for him. He did his best to clean the bases
and bring every man home by slashing a terrible fly
into deep center. The fielder, however, got under it
and pulled it down, which retired Yale without a score
and gave the Princeton rooters a chance to cheer and
cheer again.</p>

<p>The second inning was in some respects a repetition
of the first. Princeton obtained one score, but
this time it was Benson who muffed the fly, instead
of Mason, letting in the runner.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” gasped Nash. “Wasn’t that a shame!”</p>

<p>“How in the world did Lib do it?” growled Cowles,
in deep disgust. “But that is the first one he has
dropped for a long while.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame!” said Webb. “Now, if it had been
Mason again&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We’d all raised a howl,” said Mullen dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>The scoring stopped right there, for Starbright
struck out the next two men.</p>

<p>Benson was sore enough with himself, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p>Yale did her level best to score, but Vinton was in
first-class form, and not a tally was made.</p>

<p>The third inning proved to be a whitewash for both
sides.</p>

<p>Then came the fourth, and a combination of errors
and hits gave Princeton two more runs, besides filling
the bases after that.</p>

<p>Then Merriwell was forced to pull Starbright out
again and go into the box himself. The Yale crowd
rose up and greeted Frank with a wild roar of satisfaction
and relief.</p>

<p>For the time Merry put all thoughts of Inza away
from him. He was compelled to do so. Thus far
Yale had not made a run, while Princeton had four
to her credit. This game must be won somehow.</p>

<p>One man was out when Merry entered the box.
Hodge was in fighting humor, as Frank saw by the
black look on his face.</p>

<p>Merry called Bart down, and they met to have a
few quiet words.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, old man,” said Merry. “We’ll win
this game. The boys have not struck their gait yet.”</p>

<p>“They never would if you had remained on the
bench,” growled Bart. “In some things, Merriwell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
you do have bad judgment. You knew just what this
game meant to us, and yet, after keeping one man on
the team against protests, you let Starbright go in
to pitch. Why in thunder you did it no man knows!”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Frank quietly.</p>

<p>He had not told Hodge of the news from Inza.
Merry went back to the box and began to use the
double-shoot without delay; but Hodge was so irritated
that he could not hold it. Twice he let the ball
drop to the ground, and once it twisted off to one
side, nearly giving the man on third an opening to
come home.</p>

<p>Frank frowned, for he was getting worried.
Plainly the whole team was in a bad way, but Hodge
was worse than any of the rest.</p>

<p>A rise caused the batter to lift a high fly foul, and
the third-baseman captured it.</p>

<p>Two men were out.</p>

<p>Frank tried speed, giving Hodge something to do
to hold the terrific pitching. This made Bart angrier
than ever, and he closed his teeth and froze onto them.</p>

<p>With the aid of good head-work, Merriwell was
able to strike out the last man, which kept Princeton
from getting any more scores.</p>

<p>Merry tried to arouse his men, but still Vinton
worked them cleverly and kept them from scoring.</p>

<p>By the time the fifth inning began Hodge had cooled
down, and he could take Merriwell’s pitching in handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
style. Then, in his usual form, Frank struck
out three men straight, which set the Yale bleachers
wild with joy.</p>

<p>Still, though a runner reached third, Yale could not
score. For five straight innings she had been whitewashed.</p>

<p>The crowd on the Princeton bleachers were singing
“The Orange and the Black,” and everything looked
gloomy for Yale. However, the Yale side kept up
the cheering.</p>

<p>In the sixth, Princeton came near squeezing in another
run, but a great throw from Gamp cut the runner
off at the plate.</p>

<p>Frank congratulated Joe when the men came in
from the field.</p>

<p>Still Merriwell himself was worried, although he
tried not to show it. His mind was inclined to wander,
and he feared he might give some batter the kind
of ball he was looking for, which would result in more
scores for the enemy.</p>

<p>But Princeton had enough already if she could hold
Yale down.</p>

<p>Frank led the batting in the sixth, and he obtained
a clean two-bagger.</p>

<p>“Here is where we start!” cried Ready.</p>

<p>But it proved to be where they stopped, for Morgan
put up a fly that was easily captured, Gamp followed
suit, and Mason struck out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“That man can’t play a-field and he can’t hit the
ball!” growled Gil Cowles. “He lost the last Princeton
game, and I count him as the loser of this game.
He gave them the first run.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the game isn’t lost yet,” said Nash.</p>

<p>“It is,” asserted Cowles. “I’ve got that feeling in
my bones. We can’t win. It’s tough on Merriwell,
but he brought it on himself by sticking to Mason
against the advice and protests of everybody. His
own bad judgment has brought him defeat.”</p>

<p>The spell was broken in the seventh, for Yale
squeezed in a single score.</p>

<p>In the eighth Princeton got another, making five
in all, and seeming to clinch the game.</p>

<p>Yale put up a desperate fight in her half, but one
score was the best she could do, leaving the Tigers
still three in the lead.</p>

<p>“Alas!” said Jack Ready.</p>

<p>Merriwell never gave up hope, but he could see that
his men were feeling that defeat could not be averted,
and he knew that was a bad way for a nine to feel.</p>

<p>The first man got his base on balls. A double play
should have followed, but, instead of that, Ready
fumbled and permitted the man on first to reach second
and the batter to get down to first.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow!” gasped Jack. “I’m it! Refuse me!
I’ll have to look for a small hole to crawl into after
this game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank was cautious now, but the umpire would not
give him the corners, so that the next batter got a
“life” on balls and the bags were filled.</p>

<p>Merry used the double-shoot.</p>

<p>“One strike!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>The next one whistled.</p>

<p>“One ball.”</p>

<p>Frank tried a drop.</p>

<p>Out in deep center something started Hock Mason
to running in just as Frank delivered that ball. When
the game was over Hock could not explain how it
happened that he started so soon, but he knew he was
running before the bat met the ball.</p>

<p>Crack!&mdash;the batter hit it.</p>

<p>Every man ran, for it seemed certain that the hit
was safe, going over second, but being bound to drop
far inside the reach of the outfield.</p>

<p>In truth, had not Mason obtained his start just
when he did, and had he not started in the right direction,
he never could have touched that ball.</p>

<p>Of course, he was seen running for it, but no one
reckoned he had obtained such headway, and so it
was thought he would not be within a rod of it when
it touched the ground.</p>

<p>Never in all his life had Mason covered ground so
fast. He fairly flew along. He saw the ball dropping,
and, with a great forward diving leap, he scooped
it up just before it touched the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>Being unable to stop, Mason held fast to the ball
and ran over second with it in his hands, thus putting
out the batter and the runner who had left second.</p>

<p>But the runner on third had been sent home, which
he had reached by this time. A howl went up for
him to go back, but he could not comprehend what it
meant, for it had seemed to him that no man could
catch the ball.</p>

<p>Straight on toward third ran Mason, having taken
a single glance to see if the runner was trying to get
back. With the ball in his hands he touched third,
thus making one of the most astonishing plays ever
witnessed on a ball-field, for, unassisted, he had put
out three men and retired the side!</p>

<p>When the spectators understood this there was a
thunderous uproar. A triple play unassisted was a
marvel indeed. Yale cheered and cheered, ending with
the name of Mason.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell looked pleased, while the bewildered
Princeton players could not realize that the side
was out.</p>

<p>But now came the last half of the ninth, and Yale
was three scores behind. Carson was the first batter
up. He shut his teeth and picked out a good one, off
which he made a single.</p>

<p>Then came Browning, but in this emergency Bruce
fanned.</p>

<p>Merriwell longed to hit it out, but he played a waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
game on Vinton, who was afraid to give Frank
just what he wanted, and so Merry got his base on
balls.</p>

<p>Morgan was nervous. He was seen to tremble, but
he made a desperate bid for a hit, which Clackson succeeded
in getting. Two men were out.</p>

<p>“It’s all over!” shouted somebody on the Princeton
side. “Too bad. Poor old Yale!”</p>

<p>Gamp had a wild glare in his eyes when he came
up to strike. He looked toward Frank and received
a signal to play a waiting game.</p>

<p>Vinton was cautious, and Joe, though longing to
baste the ball, obeyed instructions, with the result that
he was given four balls.</p>

<p>The bases were filled.</p>

<p>“Oh, for a home run now!” exclaimed Irving Nash.</p>

<p>“The game is lost!” asserted Gil Cowles. “Mason
is the hitter. He’s as good as cooked.”</p>

<p>Mason was given a cheer as he came up, which
seemed to rattle him, for he slashed at a very wild
one on the very start.</p>

<p>“All over!” asserted Cowles. “He has done all he
can do to-day. With a good man in his place there
might be a show.”</p>

<p>Mason was pale as death. He knew all eyes were
on him, and it was the desire of his soul to get a
safe hit. Still, he knew he had made a fool of himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
by striking at the other ball, and he let the next
one pass.</p>

<p>“Two strikes,” announced the voice of the umpire.</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out on Mason. In that moment
he suffered untold tortures. He felt that he would
give his very life for a good clean hit.</p>

<p>The next ball was an out curve, and Hock started
to swing at it. Seeing it was going wide, he stopped,
but he shuddered for fear the umpire would call it
the third strike.</p>

<p>“One ball,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>The heart of the Southerner gave a great choking
throb.</p>

<p>The next one was too close, and he did not offer
at that.</p>

<p>“Two balls.”</p>

<p>“Now Vinton will put one over,” said Cowles. “It’s
all off. Let’s get away, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” urged Nash. “An accident may happen.
Heaven knows I am praying for one!”</p>

<p>Vinton, however, did not get the range of the plate,
and still Mason remained motionless.</p>

<p>“Three balls,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Then at that moment a great calmness came on
Hock Mason. He knew Vinton must put the next one
over, and he gripped the bat hard.</p>

<p>Vinton did it, and Hock hit the ball fairly. It did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
not seem to him that he hit it very hard, but that ball
shot off straight as a bullet from a gun.</p>

<p>Then a frightful uproar arose, and every runner
started. Mason ran as if his life depended on it.
And the Yale bleachers were in such a mad tumult
that it seemed as if a mob of maniacs were trying to
destroy each other.</p>

<p>The ball was not caught, and out into the field it
bounded, with a fielder chasing it.</p>

<p>Mason kept on to second. He could not hear the
coachers, but he saw somebody at third wildly beckoning
for him to come on. With a haze before his
eyes he dashed for third. When he got there he
seemed to see those arms waving him toward home.
He did not stop. Into his head came a wild thought
of the glory of this achievement, and he felt that he
would willingly drop dead on the home plate if he
could reach it in safety.</p>

<p>How the Yale men thundered and shrieked and
screamed and went mad, as Mason tore down to the
home plate.</p>

<p>Hock did not hear anybody tell him to slide, but
he felt the danger, saw the catcher ready to take the
ball, and threw himself along the ground.</p>

<p>The ball reached the catcher, who swept his arm
round with it in his grasp.</p>

<p>Too late!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Mason’s breast was on the rubber plate, and Yale
had won by a score of six to five.</p>

<p>Then the crowd came down into the diamond and
picked Mason up. Tears ran down his face as they
lifted him to their shoulders and roared his name
again and again. Frank Merriwell was lifted beside
him, and Frank smiled upon him.</p>

<p>Never again as long as he lived would Hock Mason
experience the untold joy of that thrilling moment.</p>
